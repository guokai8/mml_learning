## Key Takeaways

- **Early fusion:** Raw data level, high dimensionality, rarely used
- **Mid fusion:** Feature level, standard approach, recommended
- **Late fusion:** Decision level, modular, handles missing data well
- **Transformers:** Modern approach, automatic fusion
- **Missing modalities:** Solutions include independent models, adaptive weighting, imputation
- **Choose based on:** Data characteristics, modality importance, missing data handling
