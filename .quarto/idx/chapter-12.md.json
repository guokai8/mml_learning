Efficient training\n   Mixed precision (FP32 → FP16 or lower)\n   Gradient checkpointing\n   Better optimization algorithms\n\n3. Green computing\n   Use renewable energy data centers\n   Optimize cooling\n   Hardware efficiency\n\n4. Compute awareness\n   Only train when necessary\n   Reuse models instead of retraining\n   Share pre-trained models\n\nExample carbon calc:\n  Original model: 550 tons CO₂\n  Distilled model: 20 tons CO₂ to train\n  Deployed 1 billion times\n\n  Amortized: 0.00000002 tons per inference\n  Responsible AI requires thinking at scale\n```\n\n### Challenge 4: Misinformation and Deepfakes\n\n**The problem:**\n\n```\nGenerative models can create:\n  ① Deepfake videos\n  ② Synthetic but realistic images\n  ③ False information at scale\n  ④ Manipulated media\n\nExamples:\n  Deepfake politician videos\n  Fake evidence in legal cases\n  Stock market manipulation through false news\n  Celebrity impersonation\n\nChallenges:\n  Detection hard (adversarial arms race)\n  Detection itself can become tool for abuse\n  Rapid spread before fact-checking\n```\n\n**Addressing misinformation:**\n\n```\nTechnical approaches:\n\n1.
