Positional Encoding\nProblem: Self-attention is permutation invariant\n  Meaning: Word order doesn't matter!\n\n  Attention doesn't care about position\n  Just about content similarity\n\n  Example:\n    \"dog bites man\" vs \"man bites dog\"\n    Same words, different meaning\n    But attention treats them the same!\n\nSolution: Add position information\n\nSinusoidal encoding:\n  PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))\n  PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))\n\n  Where:\n    pos = position in sequence (0, 1, 2, ...)\n    i = dimension index (0, 1, 2, ..., d_model/2)\n\nExample: Position 0, dimension 0\n  PE(0, 0) = sin(0) = 0\n\n  Position 1, dimension 0:\n  PE(1, 0) = sin(1 / 10000^0) = sin(1) ≈ 0.84\n\nProperties:\n  ① Different positions have different encodings\n  ② Patterns repeat at different frequencies\n  ③ Model can learn relative positions\n  ④ Can extrapolate to longer sequences than training\n2. Multi-Head Self-Attention\nAll positions attend to all positions\n8-12 heads typically\nEach head learns different patterns\n\nOutput same shape as input\n3. Add & Normalize (Residual Connection + Layer Normalization)\nResidual connection:\n  output = attention_output + input\n\n  Why?\n  ① Preserves original information\n  ② Enables deep networks (gradient flows directly)\n  ③ Output can learn \"residual\" (difference)\n\nLayer Normalization:\n  Normalize across feature dimension\n\n  mean = mean(x along d_model dimension)\n  variance = var(x along d_model dimension)\n  normalized = (x - mean) / sqrt(variance + epsilon)\n  output = γ * normalized + β\n\n  γ, β are learnable parameters\n\n  Why LN instead of Batch Norm?\n  ① Batch norm depends on batch statistics\n     Different at train/test time\n\n  ② Layer norm is deterministic\n     Doesn't depend on batch\n     Same at train/test\n\n  ③ Works better for sequences\n4. Feed-Forward Network\nMLP with 2 layers and ReLU:\n\nFFN(x) = Linear2(ReLU(Linear1(x)))\n\nDimensions:\n  Linear1: d_model → d_ff (usually 4*d_model)\n  ReLU: d_ff → d_ff\n  Linear2: d_ff → d_model\n\nExample with d_model = 512:\n  Linear1: 512 → 2048\n  ReLU: 2048 → 2048\n  Linear2: 2048 → 512\n\nWhy expand then contract?\n  ① Increases non-linearity\n  ② More expressive intermediate representation\n  ③ Standard in deep learning\n\n\n\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):\nArchitecture:\n  ① Input: Tokens or subword units\n\n  ② Embeddings:\n     - Token embedding (word id → vector)\n     - Positional embedding (position → vector)\n     - Segment embedding (which sentence)\n     - Sum all three\n\n  ③ 12 layers (BERT-base) or 24 (BERT-large) of:\n     - Multi-head attention (8-12 heads)\n     - Feed-forward network\n     - Residual connections + Layer norm\n\n  ④ Output: Contextual embedding for each token\n\nExample input: \"The cat sat on the mat\"\n\nProcessing:\n  [CLS] The cat sat on the mat [SEP]\n    ↓\n  Embed each token\n    ↓\n  Add positional info\n    ↓\n  Layer 1:\n    All tokens attend to all tokens\n    Self-attention with 12 different heads\n\n    \"The\" attends to: \"The\" (self), \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", \"the\", \"mat\"\n    Different heads pay attention to different words\n    Results concatenated\n\n    Feed-forward applied to each position\n    Residual + Layer norm\n\n  Layer 2-12:\n    Same process, but input is output from previous layer\n    Further refinement\n\nOutput:\n  12 vectors for each token\n  Plus one special [CLS] token representing full sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem:\nDuring inference, generate one token at a time:\n  Step 1: Predict token 1 (no prior tokens)\n  Step 2: Predict token 2 (given token 1)\n  Step 3: Predict token 3 (given tokens 1, 2)\n\nDuring training (teacher forcing):\n  Complete sequence available: token 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nTo prepare model for inference:\n  Hide future tokens during training\n\nMechanism: Causal mask\nCausal mask visualization:\nAttention positions (what can attend to what):\n\nSequence: [token_1, token_2, token_3, token_4, token_5]\n\nPosition 1 (token_1):\n  Can attend to: position 1\n  Cannot attend to: positions 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nPosition 2 (token_2):\n  Can attend to: positions 1, 2\n  Cannot attend to: positions 3, 4, 5\n\nPosition 3 (token_3):\n  Can attend to: positions 1, 2, 3\n  Cannot attend to: positions 4, 5\n\nAttention matrix (✓ = can attend, ✗ = masked):\n\n       pos1  pos2  pos3  pos4  pos5\npos1    ✓     ✗     ✗     ✗     ✗\npos2    ✓     ✓     ✗     ✗     ✗\npos3    ✓     ✓     ✓     ✗     ✗\npos4    ✓     ✓     ✓     ✓     ✗\npos5    ✓     ✓     ✓     ✓     ✓\n\nMask implementation:\n  Before softmax, set masked positions to -∞\n  softmax(-∞) = 0\n  Effect: Attention weight = 0 for masked positions\n\n\n\nProcess:\n① Start: Input special token [START]\n         Decoder produces distribution over vocabulary\n\n② Step 1: Sample/select token with highest probability\n          Let's say we get \"A\"\n\n③ Step 2: Input \"[START] A\"\n          Decoder predicts next token\n          Get \"red\"\n\n④ Step 3: Input \"[START] A red\"\n          Decoder predicts next token\n          Get \"cat\"\n\n⑤ Continue until [END] token or max length\n\nGenerated: \"A red cat\"\nKey points:\n① Causal masking ensures only past tokens visible\n② Gradual refinement of representation\n③ Can use greedy (highest probability) or sampling\n④ Sampling: More diverse but less controlled\n   Greedy: More consistent but can repeat\n\n\n\nIntegration with encoder:\nEncoder processes source:\n  e.g., Image encoded to 196 patch embeddings\n\nDecoder:\n  ① Self-attention: Decoder attends to previously generated tokens\n  ② Cross-attention: Decoder attends to encoder output\n  ③ Feed-forward\n\nCross-attention details:\n  Query: Current decoder hidden state\n  Key/Value: Encoder output\n\n  Result: Decoder can look at source modality\n          Ground generation in input\nExample -

Positional Encoding\nProblem: Self-attention is permutation invariant\n  Meaning: Word order doesn't matter!\n\n  Attention doesn't care about position\n  Just about content similarity\n\n  Example:\n    \"dog bites man\" vs \"man bites dog\"\n    Same words, different meaning\n    But attention treats them the same!\n\nSolution: Add position information\n\nSinusoidal encoding:\n  PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))\n  PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))\n\n  Where:\n    pos = position in sequence (0, 1, 2, ...)\n    i = dimension index (0, 1, 2, ..., d_model/2)\n\nExample: Position 0, dimension 0\n  PE(0, 0) = sin(0) = 0\n\n  Position 1, dimension 0:\n  PE(1, 0) = sin(1 / 10000^0) = sin(1) ≈ 0.84\n\nProperties:\n  ① Different positions have different encodings\n  ② Patterns repeat at different frequencies\n  ③ Model can learn relative positions\n  ④ Can extrapolate to longer sequences than training\n2. Multi-Head Self-Attention\nAll positions attend to all positions\n8-12 heads typically\nEach head learns different patterns\n\nOutput same shape as input\n3. Add & Normalize (Residual Connection + Layer Normalization)\nResidual connection:\n  output = attention_output + input\n\n  Why?\n  ① Preserves original information\n  ② Enables deep networks (gradient flows directly)\n  ③ Output can learn \"residual\" (difference)\n\nLayer Normalization:\n  Normalize across feature dimension\n\n  mean = mean(x along d_model dimension)\n  variance = var(x along d_model dimension)\n  normalized = (x - mean) / sqrt(variance + epsilon)\n  output = γ * normalized + β\n\n  γ, β are learnable parameters\n\n  Why LN instead of Batch Norm?\n  ① Batch norm depends on batch statistics\n     Different at train/test time\n\n  ② Layer norm is deterministic\n     Doesn't depend on batch\n     Same at train/test\n\n  ③ Works better for sequences\n4.

    "text": "Multimodal learning represents one of the most exciting frontiers in artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches that focus on a single type of data—images, text, or audio—multimodal systems process and integrate information from multiple modalities simultaneously, much like how humans perceive and understand the world.\n\n\nConsider how you understand a movie: you don’t just see images or just hear sound. You experience both together, and your brain seamlessly integrates visual and auditory information to create a coherent understanding. Similarly, when reading a news article with photographs, you combine text and images to grasp the full story. This is multimodality in its essence.\nIn the age of AI, multimodal systems are becoming increasingly important because:\n\nReal-world data is inherently multimodal - Most information available today comes in multiple formats (images with captions, videos with audio, documents with images)\nComplementary information improves understanding - Different modalities provide different perspectives, making systems more robust and capable\nBetter user experiences - Multimodal systems can process diverse inputs and generate diverse outputs, making AI more natural and accessible\nFoundation for next-generation AI - Large multimodal models (like GPT-4V) are becoming the core of modern AI systems\n\n\n\n\nThis comprehensive guide is designed for:\n\nStudents learning about multimodal AI, computer vision, and NLP\nResearchers wanting to understand state-of-the-art methods and contribute to the field\nPractitioners building multimodal systems in production environments\nAI enthusiasts curious about how modern models like CLIP, DALL-E, and GPT-4V work\nInstructors teaching courses on deep learning, multimodal AI, or related topics\n\n\n\n\nBy completing this book, you will:\n\nUnderstand the fundamental concepts and challenges of multimodal learning\nLearn how to represent different modalities (text, images, audio) as features\nMaster techniques for aligning and fusing multimodal information\nUnderstand modern architectures (Transformers, attention mechanisms)\nLearn about contrastive learning and its revolutionary impact\nUnderstand both discriminative (understanding) and generative (creation) tasks\nStudy seminal models (CLIP, BLIP-2, GPT-4V, Vision Transformers)\nGain practical knowledge for implementing multimodal systems\nExplore advanced topics and future research directions\n\n\n\n\nEach chapter follows a consistent structure:\n\nLearning Objectives - What you should understand after reading\nCore Concepts - Fundamental ideas explained with intuitive examples\nMathematical Framework - Formal definitions and equations where appropriate\nReal-World Examples - How concepts apply to practical scenarios\nKey Insights - Summary of most important takeaways\nFurther Reading - References to papers and resources for deeper learning\n\n\n\n\nTo get the most from this book, you should have:\n\nFoundational ML knowledge - Understanding of neural networks, backpropagation, optimization\nSome experience with Python - Code examples are provided in PyTorch\nBasic linear algebra - Matrix operations, vector spaces\nFamiliarity with deep learning frameworks - PyTorch or TensorFlow\n\nDon’t worry if you’re not expert in all areas—we provide references and explanations where needed.\n\n\n\nThis book combines three elements:\n\nTheoretical rigor - Mathematical foundations and proofs where appropriate\nPractical guidance - Implementation details, code examples, deployment considerations\nIntuitive explanations - Plain English explanations for complex concepts, using analogies and examples\n\nWe believe understanding requires all three: knowing the “why” (theory), “how” (implementation), and “what” (applications).\n\nNext: How to Use This Book | Home: Table of Contents",

    "text": "Previous: Chapter 6: Attention Mechanisms in Multimodal Systems | Next: Chapter 8: Transformer Architecture | Home: Table of Contents\n\n\n\nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to: - Understand contrastive learning principles and motivation - Implement InfoNCE loss - Understand CLIP’s revolutionary approach - Compare different contrastive methods - Apply contrastive learning to your own problems\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard approach:\nTraining data: (input, label) pairs\n\nTask: Image classification\n  Input: Image\n  Label: \"cat\" or \"dog\"\n\n  Process:\n  ① Pass image through network\n  ② Output logits for each class\n  ③ Cross-entropy loss compares to label\n  ④ Backprop updates weights\n\nRequirements:\n  ✗ Requires labels for everything\n  ✗ Labels are expensive (human annotation)\n  ✗ Limited to labeled dataset size\n  ✗ New task = new labeled data needed\nBottleneck in practice:\nProblem: Most data is unlabeled\n\nExample:\n  ImageNet: 1.4M labeled images\n  Internet: Billions of images daily\n\n  Ratio: ~1 labeled per 1 million unlabeled!\n\nQuestion: How to leverage the vast unlabeled data?\n\nTraditional supervised learning: Can't use it!\nSolution: Contrastive learning\n\n\n\nKey insight:\nDon't need explicit labels!\nCreate labels from data itself using natural structure\nExample - Image rotation prediction:\nUnlabeled image:\n  [Photo of cat]\n\nCreate self-supervised task:\n  Rotate image 90°\n\n  Rotated image → Network → Predict rotation\n\nLabel is free! (We created it by rotation)\n\nTraining:\n  ① Rotate image by random angle (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)\n  ② Network predicts angle\n  ③ Loss: Cross-entropy between predicted and actual angle\n\nResult:\n  Network learns visual representations\n  Without any human labels!\n\nBenefit:\n  Can train on billions of unlabeled images\n  Representations useful for downstream tasks\n  Transfer to real tasks with small labeled dataset\nWhy this works:\nTo predict rotation, network must understand:\n  - What's the \"up\" direction? (spatial orientation)\n  - What are objects and their structure? (semantics)\n  - What's foreground vs background? (attention)\n\nThese are useful representations for other tasks!\n\n\n\nCore concept:\nSupervised learning: \"Is this input A or B or C?\"\nContrastive learning: \"Which B is similar to A?\"\n\nExample:\n  Supervised:      \"Is this a dog?\" (Yes/No)\n  Contrastive:     \"Given this dog photo, which text matches best?\n                    A) 'A dog running'\n                    B) 'A cat sleeping'\n                    C) 'A car parked'\"\n\nContrastive doesn't need explicit labels\nJust needs relative similarities!\nWhy it’s powerful:\nAdvantage 1: No labels needed\n  ✓ Use unlabeled data directly\n  ✓ Billions of image-text pairs from web\n  ✓ Much cheaper than labeling\n\nAdvantage 2: Richer signal\n  Binary classification: Yes/No (1 bit)\n  Contrastive: Ranking among many (log₂(N) bits)\n\n  With N=1000 options:\n  Ranking gives ~10 bits of information\n  vs 1 bit for binary\n\nAdvantage 3: Metric learning\n  Directly optimize for similarity\n  Better representations for retrieval\n  Natural distance metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName breakdown: - Info = Information theory - NCE = Noise Contrastive Estimation\nGoal:\nMake positive pairs similar\nMake negative pairs dissimilar\n\nPositive pair: (cat image, \"cat\" text)\nNegative pair: (cat image, \"dog\" text)\n\n\n\nFormula:\nL = -log [ exp(sim(q,k+)/τ) / (exp(sim(q,k+)/τ) + Σⱼ exp(sim(q,k⁻ⱼ)/τ)) ]\n\nBreakdown:\n\nq = query (e.g., image)\nk+ = positive key (e.g., matching text)\nk⁻ⱼ = negative keys (non-matching texts)\nτ = temperature (controls sharpness)\nsim = similarity function (cosine, dot product)\nStep-by-step explanation:\nStep 1: Compute similarities\n  sim(query, positive) = dot product\n  sim(query, negative₁) = dot product\n  sim(query, negative₂) = dot product\n  ...\n\n  Result: Scores (could be any value)\n\nStep 2: Scale by temperature\n  Score / τ\n\n  Temperature effect:\n    τ small (0.01): Scores become extreme\n    τ normal (0.1): Moderate scaling\n    τ large (1.0): Minimal scaling\n\n  Why temperature?\n    Prevents softmax from being too sharp\n    Allows gradient flow during training\n\nStep 3: Exponential\n  exp(score / τ)\n\n  Result: All positive (e^x &gt; 0 for all x)\n\n  Effect:\n    Larger scores → larger exponents\n    Softmax then emphasizes them\n\nStep 4: Softmax (normalize)\n  exp(positive) / (exp(positive) + Σ exp(negatives))\n\n  Result: Probability in [0, 1]\n\n  Interpretation:\n    Probability that positive is highest ranked\n    Perfect: Probability = 1.0\n    Random: Probability = 1/(1+num_negatives)\n\nStep 5: Negative log\n  -log(probability)\n\n  If probability = 1.0: loss = 0 (perfect!)\n  If probability = 0.1: loss = -log(0.1) = 2.3 (bad)\n  If probability = 0.5: loss = -log(0.5) = 0.69 (medium)\n\n\n\nSetup:\nQuery: Image of red cat\nPositive: Text \"a red cat\"\nNegatives:\n  - \"a blue dog\"\n  - \"a green parrot\"\n  - \"a car\"\n\nSimilarities (before temperature):\n  sim(query, positive) = 0.8    (high, should be!)\n  sim(query, neg1) = 0.2        (low, good)\n  sim(query, neg2) = 0.15       (low, good)\n  sim(query, neg3) = 0.1        (low, good)\n\nTemperature τ = 0.1\nComputing loss:\nStep 1: Scale by temperature\n  0.8 / 0.1 = 8.0\n  0.2 / 0.1 = 2.0\n  0.15 / 0.1 = 1.5\n  0.1 / 0.1 = 1.0\n\nStep 2: Exponentials\n  e^8.0 ≈ 2981\n  e^2.0 ≈ 7.4\n  e^1.5 ≈ 4.5\n  e^1.0 ≈ 2.7\n\nStep 3: Softmax (probability)\n  2981 / (2981 + 7.4 + 4.5 + 2.7)\n  = 2981 / 2995.6\n  ≈ 0.995   (99.5% probability positive is best!)\n\nStep 4: Loss\n  loss = -log(0.995) ≈ 0.005   (very small! Model doing great)\nWhat if model was bad:\nSimilarities:\n  sim(query, positive) = 0.1    (low! bad!)\n  sim(query, neg1) = 0.5        (high! worse)\n  sim(query, neg2) = 0.4\n  sim(query, neg3) = 0.3\n\nAfter temperature scaling (τ = 0.1):\n  0.1 / 0.1 = 1.0     → e^1.0 ≈ 2.7\n  0.5 / 0.1 = 5.0     → e^5.0 ≈ 148\n  0.4 / 0.1 = 4.0     → e^4.0 ≈ 55\n  0.3 / 0.1 = 3.0     → e^3.0 ≈ 20\n\nSoftmax:\n  2.7 / (2.7 + 148 + 55 + 20)\n  = 2.7 / 225.7\n  ≈ 0.012   (1.2% probability - terrible!)\n\nLoss:\n  -log(0.012) ≈ 4.4   (very large! Forces update)\n\n\n\nMathematical properties:\n1. Bounded between 0 and log(1+N)\n   where N = number of negatives\n\n   N=10: Loss ∈ [0, log(11) ≈ 2.4]\n   N=100: Loss ∈ [0, log(101) ≈ 4.6]\n\n   Interpretable scale\n\n2. Gradient is informative\n\n   Perfect case (prob ≈ 1): gradient ≈ 0\n   Good case (prob ≈ 0.9): gradient ≈ small\n   Bad case (prob ≈ 0.1): gradient ≈ large\n\n   Automatically focuses on hard cases\n\n3.

Natural supervision:\nLanguage is natural way to describe images\nNot forced to 1000 classes like ImageNet\nFlexible descriptors\nCan specify any attribute\n3. Zero-shot transfer:\nNo fine-tuning needed\nImmediate deployment\nNo labeled data required\nGeneralizes across domains\n4. Open-ended prediction:\nNot limited to predefined classes\nCan describe images with any text\n\"A cat wearing a hat\"\n\"A red car on a mountain\"\nAny description works!\n\n\n\nCLIP (April 2021) was watershed moment\n\nBefore CLIP:\n  - Supervised learning paradigm dominant\n  - Limited to ImageNet 1000 classes\n  - Required labeled data for new tasks\n  - Struggled on out-of-distribution data\n\nAfter CLIP:\n  - Contrastive learning became mainstream\n  - Foundation model era began\n  - Zero-shot transfer became practical\n  - Industry adopted language-grounded vision\n\nInspired:\n  - ALIGN (Google)\n  - LiT (Google)\n  - COCA (Meta)\n  - Flamingo (DeepMind)\n  - BLIP (Salesforce)\n  - Many others...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotivation:\nCLIP uses text for supervision\nWhat if we only have unlabeled images?\n\nAnswer: Use image augmentations as \"supervision\"\nCore idea:\nSingle image:\n  [Original cat photo]\n\nCreate two augmented versions:\n  [Rotated, cropped, color-adjusted]\n  [Different rotation, crop, colors]\n\nTreat as positive pair:\n  Both should have similar representations\n  (Same cat, different augmentations)\n\nNegatives:\n  Other images in batch\n\nLoss: Make augmentations similar,\n      other images dissimilar\nProcess:\n1. Sample image x from dataset\n\n2. Create two augmented versions:\n   x_i = Aug(x)  (augmentation 1)\n   x_j = Aug(x)  (augmentation 2)\n\n   Different random augmentations!\n\n3. Encode both through network f:\n   h_i = f(x_i)\n   h_j = f(x_j)\n\n4. Project to embedding space:\n   z_i = g(h_i)\n   z_j = g(h_j)\n\n5. Contrastive loss:\n   sim(z_i, z_j) should be high\n   sim(z_i, z_k) should be low (for k ≠ i,j)\n\n6. Backprop updates f and g\nKey insights:\nWhy this works:\n\nAssumptions:\n  1. Augmentations preserve content\n  2. Different images are different\n\nImplications:\n  Model learns representations that:\n  - Survive augmentations (robust features)\n  - Differ between images (discriminative features)\n  - Capture semantic content (not style)\n\nResult:\n  Representations useful for downstream tasks\n  Without any labels!\nAugmentations used:\nStrong augmentations needed for self-supervised learning:\n\nRandom crop:\n  (up to 85% crop)\n  ↑ Forces learning of part representations\n\nColor jittering:\n  Brightness, contrast, saturation, hue\n  ↑ Prevents learning from color only\n\nGaussian blur:\n  Blurs fine details\n  ↑ Forces learning of structure, not pixels\n\nRandom grayscale:\n  Removes color information\n  ↑ Forces learning of shape and texture\n\nGaussian noise:\n  Adds random noise\n  ↑ Makes features robust\n\nNote: Extreme augmentations avoid (would destroy content)\n  - Extreme rotation: Flips meaning\n  - Extreme scaling: Makes object invisible\n  - Extreme distortion: No longer recognizable\nDifferences from CLIP:\n                SimCLR          CLIP\n────────────────────────────────────\nSupervision     Image augment   Text\nData            Unlabeled       Image-caption pairs\nRequires        Images only     Images + text\nGeneralization  Moderate        Excellent\nTask alignment  Generic vision  Language grounding\nTransfer        Good            Excellent\nInterpretable   No              Yes (language)\n\nWhen to use:\n  SimCLR: When you only have unlabeled images\n  CLIP: When you have image-caption pairs\n\n\n\nProblem with SimCLR:\nSimCLR requires large batch size:\n  - Small batch: Few negatives → weak learning signal\n  - Large batch: Better negatives → better learning\n\n  Batch size 4096 requires massive GPU memory\n  And distributed training complexity\nMoCo solution:\nUse memory bank instead of current batch\n\nBenefits:\n  ✓ Can use smaller batch size\n  ✓ Negatives more diverse (from different times)\n  ✓ More efficient\nArchitecture:\nOnline encoder: f_q\n  Learns from current batch\n  Updated every step\n\nMemory bank: Queue\n  Stores recent representations\n  Old representations pushed out as new added\n\nMomentum encoder: f_k\n  Slowly following online encoder\n  f_k = α × f_k + (1-α) × f_q\n\n  Typically α = 0.999\n  Moves slowly (momentum!)\n\nProcess:\n\n1. Current batch through online encoder\n   → query embeddings q\n\n2. Pop old representations from queue\n   → memory negatives\n\n3. Compute loss using:\n   - query from online encoder (positive)\n   - memory from momentum encoder (negatives)\n\n4. Push new representations to queue\n\n5. Update momentum encoder (slowly follows online)\nWhy momentum encoder:\nWithout it:\n  Queue contains representations from old network\n  Network keeps changing → representations inconsistent\n  Training unstable\n\nWith momentum encoder:\n  Queue contains representations from slow network\n  Representations are consistent\n  Training stable\n\nEffect:\n  Momentum = inertia\n  Small updates accumulate\n  Smooth trajectory\nPerformance:\nImageNet pre-training → transfer to other tasks\n\n                Top-1 Accuracy\n────────────────────────────────\nSupervised      76.5% (ResNet-50)\nSimCLR          69.3% (requires large batch)\nMoCo v1         60.6% (with 65K negatives)\nMoCo v2         71.3% (improved version)\nMoCo v3         76.7% (vision transformer)\n\nNote: Self-supervised eventually matched supervised!\n      Shows power of approach\n\n\n\nSurprising finding (Grill et al., 2020):\nDo we even need negative examples?\n\nTraditional contrastive:\n  Make positives similar\n  Make negatives dissimilar\n\nBYOL:\n  Only make positives similar\n  No explicit negatives!\n\nQuestion: How does this work?\n\nAnswer: Still has implicit negatives\n        (Through model architecture and learning dynamics)\nArchitecture:\nOnline network:\n  Encoder f + Projector g\n  Input: image → output: representation\n  Updated every step\n\nTarget network:\n  Copy of online network\n  Parameter updates: EMA (exponential moving average)\n  target_param = α × target_param + (1-α) × online_param\n\nPredictor h:\n  Additional MLP on top of online network\n  NOT on target network (asymmetry!)\n\nLoss:\n  For two augmentations of same image:\n  loss = ||h(online(aug1)) - target(aug2)||²\n\n  Make online and target predictions close\n  Using MSE loss (not contrastive!)\n\n  Also symmetrically:\n  loss += ||h(online(aug2)) - target(aug1)||²\nWhy this works (still debated!):\nPossible explanations:\n\n1. Implicit negatives through optimization\n   - Mini-batch gradient descent creates diversity\n   - Network can't collapse to constant\n   - Similar to negative mining\n\n2. Momentum encoder provides stability\n   - Target network changes slowly\n   - Creates effective \"negatives\" through difference\n\n3.

    "text": "Motivation:\nCLIP uses text for supervision\nWhat if we only have unlabeled images?\n\nAnswer: Use image augmentations as \"supervision\"\nCore idea:\nSingle image:\n  [Original cat photo]\n\nCreate two augmented versions:\n  [Rotated, cropped, color-adjusted]\n  [Different rotation, crop, colors]\n\nTreat as positive pair:\n  Both should have similar representations\n  (Same cat, different augmentations)\n\nNegatives:\n  Other images in batch\n\nLoss: Make augmentations similar,\n      other images dissimilar\nProcess:\n1. Sample image x from dataset\n\n2. Create two augmented versions:\n   x_i = Aug(x)  (augmentation 1)\n   x_j = Aug(x)  (augmentation 2)\n\n   Different random augmentations!\n\n3. Encode both through network f:\n   h_i = f(x_i)\n   h_j = f(x_j)\n\n4. Project to embedding space:\n   z_i = g(h_i)\n   z_j = g(h_j)\n\n5. Contrastive loss:\n   sim(z_i, z_j) should be high\n   sim(z_i, z_k) should be low (for k ≠ i,j)\n\n6. Backprop updates f and g\nKey insights:\nWhy this works:\n\nAssumptions:\n  1. Augmentations preserve content\n  2. Different images are different\n\nImplications:\n  Model learns representations that:\n  - Survive augmentations (robust features)\n  - Differ between images (discriminative features)\n  - Capture semantic content (not style)\n\nResult:\n  Representations useful for downstream tasks\n  Without any labels!\nAugmentations used:\nStrong augmentations needed for self-supervised learning:\n\nRandom crop:\n  (up to 85% crop)\n  ↑ Forces learning of part representations\n\nColor jittering:\n  Brightness, contrast, saturation, hue\n  ↑ Prevents learning from color only\n\nGaussian blur:\n  Blurs fine details\n  ↑ Forces learning of structure, not pixels\n\nRandom grayscale:\n  Removes color information\n  ↑ Forces learning of shape and texture\n\nGaussian noise:\n  Adds random noise\n  ↑ Makes features robust\n\nNote: Extreme augmentations avoid (would destroy content)\n  - Extreme rotation: Flips meaning\n  - Extreme scaling: Makes object invisible\n  - Extreme distortion: No longer recognizable\nDifferences from CLIP:\n                SimCLR          CLIP\n────────────────────────────────────\nSupervision     Image augment   Text\nData            Unlabeled       Image-caption pairs\nRequires        Images only     Images + text\nGeneralization  Moderate        Excellent\nTask alignment  Generic vision  Language grounding\nTransfer        Good            Excellent\nInterpretable   No              Yes (language)\n\nWhen to use:\n  SimCLR: When you only have unlabeled images\n  CLIP: When you have image-caption pairs\n\n\n\nProblem with SimCLR:\nSimCLR requires large batch size:\n  - Small batch: Few negatives → weak learning signal\n  - Large batch: Better negatives → better learning\n\n  Batch size 4096 requires massive GPU memory\n  And distributed training complexity\nMoCo solution:\nUse memory bank instead of current batch\n\nBenefits:\n  ✓ Can use smaller batch size\n  ✓ Negatives more diverse (from different times)\n  ✓ More efficient\nArchitecture:\nOnline encoder: f_q\n  Learns from current batch\n  Updated every step\n\nMemory bank: Queue\n  Stores recent representations\n  Old representations pushed out as new added\n\nMomentum encoder: f_k\n  Slowly following online encoder\n  f_k = α × f_k + (1-α) × f_q\n\n  Typically α = 0.999\n  Moves slowly (momentum!)\n\nProcess:\n\n1. Current batch through online encoder\n   → query embeddings q\n\n2. Pop old representations from queue\n   → memory negatives\n\n3. Compute loss using:\n   - query from online encoder (positive)\n   - memory from momentum encoder (negatives)\n\n4. Push new representations to queue\n\n5. Update momentum encoder (slowly follows online)\nWhy momentum encoder:\nWithout it:\n  Queue contains representations from old network\n  Network keeps changing → representations inconsistent\n  Training unstable\n\nWith momentum encoder:\n  Queue contains representations from slow network\n  Representations are consistent\n  Training stable\n\nEffect:\n  Momentum = inertia\n  Small updates accumulate\n  Smooth trajectory\nPerformance:\nImageNet pre-training → transfer to other tasks\n\n                Top-1 Accuracy\n────────────────────────────────\nSupervised      76.5% (ResNet-50)\nSimCLR          69.3% (requires large batch)\nMoCo v1         60.6% (with 65K negatives)\nMoCo v2         71.3% (improved version)\nMoCo v3         76.7% (vision transformer)\n\nNote: Self-supervised eventually matched supervised!\n      Shows power of approach\n\n\n\nSurprising finding (Grill et al., 2020):\nDo we even need negative examples?\n\nTraditional contrastive:\n  Make positives similar\n  Make negatives dissimilar\n\nBYOL:\n  Only make positives similar\n  No explicit negatives!\n\nQuestion: How does this work?\n\nAnswer: Still has implicit negatives\n        (Through model architecture and learning dynamics)\nArchitecture:\nOnline network:\n  Encoder f + Projector g\n  Input: image → output: representation\n  Updated every step\n\nTarget network:\n  Copy of online network\n  Parameter updates: EMA (exponential moving average)\n  target_param = α × target_param + (1-α) × online_param\n\nPredictor h:\n  Additional MLP on top of online network\n  NOT on target network (asymmetry!)\n\nLoss:\n  For two augmentations of same image:\n  loss = ||h(online(aug1)) - target(aug2)||²\n\n  Make online and target predictions close\n  Using MSE loss (not contrastive!)\n\n  Also symmetrically:\n  loss += ||h(online(aug2)) - target(aug1)||²\nWhy this works (still debated!):\nPossible explanations:\n\n1. Implicit negatives through optimization\n   - Mini-batch gradient descent creates diversity\n   - Network can't collapse to constant\n   - Similar to negative mining\n\n2. Momentum encoder provides stability\n   - Target network changes slowly\n   - Creates effective \"negatives\" through difference\n\n3. Predictor prevents mode collapse\n   - Without predictor: Would learn trivial solution\n   - With predictor: Breaks symmetry\n   - Forces meaningful learning\n\nEmpirical results:\n  BYOL works surprisingly well!\n  Without explicit negatives!\n  Counterintuitive but effective\nAdvantages:\n✓ Doesn't need negative pairs\n✓ Don't need image-text pairs (image-only sufficient)\n✓ Works with small batches\n✓ Stable training\n✓ Strong performance (competitive with SimCLR)\nDisadvantages:\n✗ Why it works still not fully understood\n✗ Less interpretable\n✗ More complex architecture\n✗ Harder to debug when it fails",

    "text": "Previous: Chapter 2: Foundations and Core Concepts | Next: Chapter 4: Feature Alignment and Bridging Modalities | Home: Table of Contents\n\n\n\nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to: - Understand text representation methods from BoW to BERT - Explain CNNs and Vision Transformers for images - Describe MFCC and self-supervised learning for audio - Compare different modality representations - Choose appropriate representations for specific tasks\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of text representation:\n\n1950s-1990s:    Manual feature engineering\n  ↓\n1990s-2000s:    Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF\n  ↓\n2000s-2010s:    Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)\n  ↓\n2013-2018:      RNN, LSTM, GRU with embeddings\n  ↓\n2017+:          Transformer-based (BERT, GPT)\n  ↓\n2022+:          Large language models (GPT-3, LLaMA)\n  ↓\n2024+:          Multimodal LLMs\n\n\n\nConcept: Treat text as unordered collection of words, ignoring sequence and grammar.\nProcess:\nInput:     \"The cat sat on the mat\"\n             ↓\nTokenize:  [\"the\", \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", \"the\", \"mat\"]\n             ↓\nCount:     {\"the\": 2, \"cat\": 1, \"sat\": 1, \"on\": 1, \"mat\": 1}\n             ↓\nVectorize: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1]  (in vocabulary order)\nFormal definition:\nFor vocabulary V = {w_1, w_2, ..., w_N}\nText represented as: x = [c_1, c_2, ..., c_N]\nwhere c_i = count of word w_i in text\n\nDimension = vocabulary size (can be 10,000-50,000)\nExample - Classification:\nTraining data:\n  Text 1: \"I love this movie\" → Label: Positive\n  Text 2: \"This movie is bad\" → Label: Negative\n\nBoW vectors:\n  Text 1: {love: 1, movie: 1, positive words}\n  Text 2: {bad: 1, movie: 1, negative words}\n\nClassifier learns:\n  \"love\" → +positive contribution\n  \"bad\" → +negative contribution\nAdvantages: ✓ Simple and fast ✓ Interpretable ✓ Works surprisingly well for many tasks\nDisadvantages: ✗ Loses word order (“dog bit man” = “man bit dog”) ✗ No semantic relationships (“happy” vs “joyful” treated as completely different) ✗ All words equally important (doesn’t distinguish important from common words) ✗ Very high dimensionality\nWhen to use: - Spam detection - Topic modeling - Simple text classification - When simplicity and speed are priorities\n\n\n\nMotivation: BoW treats all words equally. But some words are more informative than others.\nConcept:\nImportance = (word frequency in document) × (rarity across corpus)\n\nWords appearing everywhere (\"the\", \"is\") get low weight\nWords appearing rarely but specifically (\"CEO\", \"algorithm\") get high weight\nFormal definition:\nTF (Term Frequency):\n  TF(t,d) = count(t in d) / total_words(d)\n  Normalized frequency of term t in document d\n\nIDF (Inverse Document Frequency):\n  IDF(t) = log(total_documents / documents_containing_t)\n  How rare is this term across all documents?\n\nTF-IDF:\n  TF-IDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) × IDF(t)\nExample calculation:\nCorpus: 1,000 documents\nTerm \"cat\": appears in 100 documents, 5 times in document D\n\nTF = 5 / total_words_in_D = 0.05\nIDF = log(1000/100) = log(10) = 1.0\nTF-IDF = 0.05 × 1.0 = 0.05\n\nCompare to:\nTerm \"the\": appears in 900 documents, 50 times in document D\n\nTF = 50 / total_words_in_D = 0.50\nIDF = log(1000/900) = log(1.11) ≈ 0.1\nTF-IDF = 0.50 × 0.1 = 0.05\n\nWait, same score! That's the point - importance normalized.\nBenefits over BoW: ✓ Handles different document lengths better ✓ Downweights common words ✓ Emphasizes distinctive terms\nDisadvantages: ✗ Still ignores word order ✗ No semantic understanding ✗ Requires corpus statistics ✗ Doesn’t handle synonyms\nWhen to use: - Information retrieval and search - TF-IDF is foundation of many search engines - Document classification - When you have many documents and limited compute\n\n\n\nRevolutionary idea (Mikolov et al., 2013): “Words with similar contexts have similar meanings”\nLearning through prediction:\nIdea: If we can predict context words from a word,\n      we've learned what that word means.\n\nProcess:\n\nText: \"The dog barked loudly at the mailman\"\n              ↓\nFocus on \"barked\", predict context:\n  Context: {dog, loudly, at, the}\n  Prediction task: Given \"barked\", predict these\n\nLoss: How well did we predict?\n  If good prediction → \"barked\" representation is good\n  If poor → Update \"barked\" vector\n\nAfter training on millions of sentences:\n  \"barked\" vector captures:\n  - Associated with actions\n  - Related to animals\n  - Past tense\n  - Physical events\nKey discovery:\nVector arithmetic works!\n\nking - man + woman ≈ queen\n\nExplanation:\n- \"king\" and \"queen\" appear in similar contexts (monarchy)\n- \"man\" and \"woman\" capture gender dimension\n- Vector subtraction removes gender from \"king\"\n- Vector addition applies gender to result\n- Result: \"queen\"\n\nThis algebraic structure wasn't hand-designed!\nIt emerged from learning word contexts.\nTechnical details - Two approaches:\nSkip-gram:\nInput: Target word \"barked\"\nTask: Predict context words {dog, loudly, at, the}\n\nModel: Two embedding matrices\n  Input embedding: What is \"barked\"?\n  Output embedding: What patterns lead to context?\n\nOptimization:\n  Maximize: P(context | barked)\n  Network learns useful representations\nCBOW (Continuous Bag of Words):\nInput: Context words {the, dog, barked, loudly}\nTask: Predict center word\n\nReverse of skip-gram\nCan be faster to train\nProperties: - Fixed embedding per word (doesn’t handle polysemy) - 300D vectors typical - Can be trained on unlabeled data - Transferable to downstream tasks\nExample - Semantic relationships:\ncos_sim(king, queen) ≈ 0.7   (high, related)\ncos_sim(king, man) ≈ 0.65     (high, overlapping)\ncos_sim(queen, woman) ≈ 0.68  (high, overlapping)\ncos_sim(king, dog) ≈ 0.2      (low, unrelated)\n\nStructure emerges in embedding space!\nLimitations: ✗ One vector per word (ignores context and polysemy) ✗ “Bank” (financial) and “bank” (river) have identical vectors ✗ Same word might mean different things in different contexts ✗ Doesn’t capture longer-range dependencies\nWhen to use: - Quick baseline for text tasks - When you need interpretable word relationships - Transfer learning where only word similarity needed - When computational resources are limited\n\n\n\nMotivation:\nWord2Vec limitation - context blindness:\nSentence 1: \"I went to the bank to deposit money\"\nSentence 2: \"I sat on the bank of the river\"\n\nWord2Vec:\n  \"bank\" in both sentences → IDENTICAL vector\n  Problem: Different meanings!\n\nWhat we need:\n  Context-aware \"bank\" for finance sentence\n  Different context-aware \"bank\" for river sentence\nBERT Innovation (Devlin et al., 2018): “Use entire sentence context to generate embeddings”\nArchitecture overview:\nInput text: \"The cat sat on the mat\"\n             ↓\nTokenization (using WordPiece):\n  [CLS] The cat sat on the mat [SEP]\n             ↓\nEmbedding:\n  - Token embedding (which word)\n  - Position embedding (where in sequence)\n  - Segment embedding (which sentence)\n             ↓\nTransformer encoder (12 layers):\n  Each layer:\n    - Self-attention (how relevant is each token to others)\n    - Feed-forward network\n    - Normalization\n             ↓\nOutput: 12 vectors of 768D each\n  Each token has representation influenced by entire sequence\nKey innovation - Bidirectional context:\nTraditional RNN: Left-to-right only\n  Input: \"The cat sat...\"\n         Process: The → cat → sat\n         When processing \"sat\", don't know what comes after\n\nBERT: Bidirectional\n  Input: \"The cat sat on the mat\"\n         Process: Entire sequence simultaneously\n         All positions see all other positions\n         Through self-attention in first layer\nTraining procedure - Masked Language Modeling:\nGoal: Learn good representations for any language task\n\nMethod: Predict masked words\n\nOriginal:      \"The [MASK] sat on the mat\"\nTask:          Predict the masked word\nExpected:      \"cat\"\n\nTraining:\n  ① Randomly mask 15% of tokens\n  ② Model predicts masked tokens\n  ③ Loss = cross-entropy between predicted and actual\n  ④ Update all parameters\n\nResult:\n  Model learns representations that contain\n  information about what words should appear\n  = learns semantic and syntactic patterns\nUsing BERT embeddings:\nFor sentence classification:\n  ① Process sentence through BERT\n  ② Extract [CLS] token (special classification token)\n  ③ [CLS] vector = sentence representation (768D)\n  ④ Add linear classifier on top\n  ⑤ Train classifier on downstream task\n\nFor token classification (e.g., NER):\n  ① Process sentence through BERT\n  ② Extract all token vectors (each is 768D)\n  ③ Each token has context-aware representation\n  ④ Add classifier for each token\n  ⑤ Predict label for each token\n\nBenefit:\n  - No task-specific feature engineering needed\n  - Transfer learning from massive pre-training\n  - Strong performance on small datasets\nConcrete example - Polysemy handling:\nSentence 1: \"I went to the bank to deposit money\"\n  \"bank\" → BERT embedding with finance context\n\nSentence 2: \"I sat on the bank of the river\"\n  \"bank\" → BERT embedding with geography context\n\nDifferent embeddings!\nBERT captures context from surrounding words\nProperties: - Context-dependent embeddings - 768D vectors (BERT-base) - Larger versions available (BERT-large: 1024D) - Pre-trained on 3.3B words - Extremely effective for transfer learning\nAdvantages over Word2Vec: ✓ Handles polysemy (same word, different contexts) ✓ Bidirectional context ✓ Pre-trained on massive corpus ✓ Strong transfer learning ✓ Achieves SOTA on many tasks\nDisadvantages: ✗ Computationally expensive ✗ Slower inference than Word2Vec ✗ Requires more compute resources ✗ Less interpretable (768D vectors hard to understand)\nWhen to use: - Text classification (sentiment, topic) - Named entity recognition - Question answering - Semantic similarity - When accuracy more important than speed - When GPU resources available\n\n\n\nFurther evolution -

multimodal\nLLM representations:\nGPT-3 embeddings:\n  Layer 1:    Basic patterns\n  Layer 16:   Mid-level concepts\n  Layer 32:   High-level semantics\n  Layer 48 (final): Task-specific representations\n\nProperties:\n  - 12,288D vectors (very high-dimensional)\n  - Captures vast knowledge\n  - Can be used as semantic features\n  - More interpretable than BERT in some ways\nUsing LLM embeddings for multimodal tasks:\nInstead of using fixed word embeddings,\nuse representations from large language models\n\nBenefit:\n  - Captures world knowledge from pre-training\n  - Understands complex semantics\n  - Better for rare/unusual concepts\n  - Can be adapted to specific domains\n\nCost:\n  - Expensive API calls (if using services like OpenAI)\n  -

Translation (where object is in image)\n  - Scaling (zoom level)\n  - Rotation (camera angle)\n  - Illumination (lighting changes)\n\nProcess:\n  1. Find keypoints (interest points)\n     - Corners, edges, distinctive regions\n\n  2. Describe neighborhoods around keypoints\n     - Direction and magnitude of gradients\n     - Histogram of edge orientations\n\n  3. Result: Keypoint descriptor (128D vector)\n     - Invariant to many transformations\n     - Can match same keypoint across images\n\nExample:\n  Building in Photo 1 (summer, noon, straight angle)\n  Same building in Photo 2 (winter, sunset, aerial view)\n\n  SIFT can find matching keypoints!\n  Enables: Panorama stitching, 3D reconstruction\nHOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)\nKey insight:\n  Human shape recognition relies on edge directions\n  (Horizontal edges on top = head, vertical on sides = body)\n\nProcess:\n  1. Divide image into cells (8×8 pixels)\n\n  2. For each cell:\n     - Compute edge direction at each pixel\n     - Create histogram of edge directions\n\n  3. Result: Concatenate all histograms\n     - Captures shape and edge structure\n     - Dimension: ~3,780 for 64×128 image\n\nApplication:\n  Pedestrian detection\n  - HOG captures distinctive human silhouette\n  - Works well because human shape is distinctive\n  - Fast computation (no deep learning needed)\n\n  Limitation:\n  - Only works for rigid objects (humans, faces)\n  - Fails for abstract categories\nBag-of-Visual-Words\nIdea: Apply Bag-of-Words concept to images\n\nProcess:\n  1. Extract SIFT features from image\n     → Get 100-1000 keypoint descriptors per image\n\n  2. Cluster descriptors (k-means)\n     → Create \"visual vocabulary\" (e.g., 1000 clusters)\n     → Each cluster = one \"visual word\"\n\n  3. Histogram of visual words\n     → Count which words appear in image\n     → Result: Bag-of-words vector\n\n  4. Classify or compare based on histogram\n\nExample:\n  Image 1 has: {30 \"corner edges\", 20 \"smooth curves\", ...}\n  Image 2 has: {5 \"corner edges\", 45 \"smooth curves\", ...}\n\n  More curve words → Perhaps a cat\n  More corner words → Perhaps a building\nAdvantages of hand-crafted features: ✓ Interpretable (understand what they measure) ✓ Fast computation ✓ Works with small datasets ✓ Explicit mathematical basis\nDisadvantages: ✗ Requires domain expertise to design ✗ Limited to specific feature types ✗ Poor generalization to new domains ✗ Cannot capture complex semantic patterns ✗ Manually chosen → not optimized for task\nWhen to use: - When you understand the specific patterns to detect - Limited computational resources - Small datasets - Tasks where hand-crafted features are well-suited (e.g., pedestrian detection)\n\n\n\nThe Breakthrough (AlexNet, 2012):\nRevolutionary insight:\n  \"Stop hand-crafting features!\n   Let neural networks learn what's important.\"\n\nResults:\n  ImageNet competition:\n  - 2011 (hand-crafted): 25.8% error\n  - 2012 (AlexNet): 15.3% error  ← 38% error reduction!\n  - 2015 (ResNet): 3.6% error   ← Human-level performance\nHierarchical Feature Learning:\nRaw image (224×224×3 pixels)\n        ↓\nLayer 1-2: Low-level features\n  - Edge detection\n  - Simple curves\n  - Corners\n  └─→ What: Detects local patterns\n      Why: Edges are building blocks\n      Output: 64 feature maps (32×32)\n\nLayer 3-4: Mid-level features\n  - Textures\n  - Shapes\n  - Parts\n  └─→ What: Combines local patterns\n      Why: Shapes emerge from edges\n      Output: 256 feature maps (16×16)\n\nLayer 5: High-level features\n  - Objects\n  - Semantic concepts\n  - Scene context\n  └─→ What: Object detectors\n      Why: Objects are concepts\n      Output: 512 feature maps (8×8)\n\nGlobal pooling & Dense layers:\n  - Aggregate spatial info\n  - Predict class probabilities\n  └─→ Output: Class predictions\nWhy CNNs work:\n1.

Information retrieval and search - TF-IDF is foundation of many search engines - Document classification - When you have many documents and limited compute\n\n\n\nRevolutionary idea (Mikolov et al., 2013): “Words with similar contexts have similar meanings”\nLearning through prediction:\nIdea: If we can predict context words from a word,\n      we've learned what that word means.\n\nProcess:\n\nText: \"The dog barked loudly at the mailman\"\n              ↓\nFocus on \"barked\", predict context:\n  Context: {dog, loudly, at, the}\n  Prediction task: Given \"barked\", predict these\n\nLoss: How well did we predict?\n  If good prediction → \"barked\" representation is good\n  If poor → Update \"barked\" vector\n\nAfter training on millions of sentences:\n  \"barked\" vector captures:\n  - Associated with actions\n  - Related to animals\n  - Past tense\n  - Physical events\nKey discovery:\nVector arithmetic works!\n\nking - man + woman ≈ queen\n\nExplanation:\n- \"king\" and \"queen\" appear in similar contexts (monarchy)\n- \"man\" and \"woman\" capture gender dimension\n- Vector subtraction removes gender from \"king\"\n- Vector addition applies gender to result\n- Result: \"queen\"\n\nThis algebraic structure wasn't hand-designed!\nIt emerged from learning word contexts.\nTechnical details - Two approaches:\nSkip-gram:\nInput: Target word \"barked\"\nTask: Predict context words {dog, loudly, at, the}\n\nModel: Two embedding matrices\n  Input embedding: What is \"barked\"?\n  Output embedding: What patterns lead to context?\n\nOptimization:\n  Maximize: P(context | barked)\n  Network learns useful representations\nCBOW (Continuous Bag of Words):\nInput: Context words {the, dog, barked, loudly}\nTask: Predict center word\n\nReverse of skip-gram\nCan be faster to train\nProperties: - Fixed embedding per word (doesn’t handle polysemy) - 300D vectors typical - Can be trained on unlabeled data - Transferable to downstream tasks\nExample - Semantic relationships:\ncos_sim(king, queen) ≈ 0.7   (high, related)\ncos_sim(king, man) ≈ 0.65     (high, overlapping)\ncos_sim(queen, woman) ≈ 0.68  (high, overlapping)\ncos_sim(king, dog) ≈ 0.2      (low, unrelated)\n\nStructure emerges in embedding space!\nLimitations: ✗ One vector per word (ignores context and polysemy) ✗ “Bank” (financial) and “bank” (river) have identical vectors ✗ Same word might mean different things in different contexts ✗ Doesn’t capture longer-range dependencies\nWhen to use: - Quick baseline for text tasks - When you need interpretable word relationships - Transfer learning where only word similarity needed - When computational resources are limited\n\n\n\nMotivation:\nWord2Vec limitation -

Find keypoints (interest points)\n     - Corners, edges, distinctive regions\n\n  2. Describe neighborhoods around keypoints\n     - Direction and magnitude of gradients\n     - Histogram of edge orientations\n\n  3. Result: Keypoint descriptor (128D vector)\n     - Invariant to many transformations\n     - Can match same keypoint across images\n\nExample:\n  Building in Photo 1 (summer, noon, straight angle)\n  Same building in Photo 2 (winter, sunset, aerial view)\n\n  SIFT can find matching keypoints!\n  Enables: Panorama stitching, 3D reconstruction\nHOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)\nKey insight:\n  Human shape recognition relies on edge directions\n  (Horizontal edges on top = head, vertical on sides = body)\n\nProcess:\n  1. Divide image into cells (8×8 pixels)\n\n  2. For each cell:\n     - Compute edge direction at each pixel\n     - Create histogram of edge directions\n\n  3. Result: Concatenate all histograms\n     - Captures shape and edge structure\n     - Dimension: ~3,780 for 64×128 image\n\nApplication:\n  Pedestrian detection\n  - HOG captures distinctive human silhouette\n  - Works well because human shape is distinctive\n  - Fast computation (no deep learning needed)\n\n  Limitation:\n  - Only works for rigid objects (humans, faces)\n  - Fails for abstract categories\nBag-of-Visual-Words\nIdea: Apply Bag-of-Words concept to images\n\nProcess:\n  1. Extract SIFT features from image\n     → Get 100-1000 keypoint descriptors per image\n\n  2. Cluster descriptors (k-means)\n     → Create \"visual vocabulary\" (e.g., 1000 clusters)\n     → Each cluster = one \"visual word\"\n\n  3. Histogram of visual words\n     → Count which words appear in image\n     → Result: Bag-of-words vector\n\n  4. Classify or compare based on histogram\n\nExample:\n  Image 1 has: {30 \"corner edges\", 20 \"smooth curves\", ...}\n  Image 2 has: {5 \"corner edges\", 45 \"smooth curves\", ...}\n\n  More curve words → Perhaps a cat\n  More corner words → Perhaps a building\nAdvantages of hand-crafted features: ✓ Interpretable (understand what they measure) ✓ Fast computation ✓ Works with small datasets ✓ Explicit mathematical basis\nDisadvantages: ✗ Requires domain expertise to design ✗ Limited to specific feature types ✗ Poor generalization to new domains ✗ Cannot capture complex semantic patterns ✗ Manually chosen → not optimized for task\nWhen to use: - When you understand the specific patterns to detect - Limited computational resources - Small datasets - Tasks where hand-crafted features are well-suited (e.g., pedestrian detection)\n\n\n\nThe Breakthrough (AlexNet, 2012):\nRevolutionary insight:\n  \"Stop hand-crafting features!\n   Let neural networks learn what's important.\"\n\nResults:\n  ImageNet competition:\n  - 2011 (hand-crafted): 25.8% error\n  - 2012 (AlexNet): 15.3% error  ← 38% error reduction!\n  - 2015 (ResNet): 3.6% error   ← Human-level performance\nHierarchical Feature Learning:\nRaw image (224×224×3 pixels)\n        ↓\nLayer 1-2: Low-level features\n  - Edge detection\n  - Simple curves\n  - Corners\n  └─→ What: Detects local patterns\n      Why: Edges are building blocks\n      Output: 64 feature maps (32×32)\n\nLayer 3-4: Mid-level features\n  - Textures\n  - Shapes\n  - Parts\n  └─→ What: Combines local patterns\n      Why: Shapes emerge from edges\n      Output: 256 feature maps (16×16)\n\nLayer 5: High-level features\n  - Objects\n  - Semantic concepts\n  - Scene context\n  └─→ What: Object detectors\n      Why: Objects are concepts\n      Output: 512 feature maps (8×8)\n\nGlobal pooling & Dense layers:\n  - Aggregate spatial info\n  - Predict class probabilities\n  └─→ Output: Class predictions\nWhy CNNs work:\n1.

Hierarchical composition\n   - Edges → Shapes → Objects\n   - Matches how we see\n\n3.

2048D global feature vector (before classification) - Pre-trained on ImageNet (1.4M images) - Can fine-tune on downstream tasks - Very stable training (skip connections)\nAdvantages: ✓ Learns task-relevant features ✓ Transfers well to other tasks ✓ Stable training (deep networks possible) ✓ Interpretable to some extent (visualize activations) ✓ Efficient inference\nDisadvantages: ✗ Black-box decisions (what does each dimension mean?) ✗ Requires large labeled datasets to train from scratch ✗ Inherits biases from ImageNet\nWhen to use: - Most modern computer vision tasks - Transfer learning (fine-tune on new task) - When you want strong off-the-shelf features - Production systems (mature, optimized, proven)\n\n\n\nParadigm shift (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020):\nTraditional thinking:\n  \"Images need CNNs!\"\n  Reason: Spatial structure, translational equivariance\n\nViT question:\n  \"What if we just use Transformers like NLP?\"\n  Insight: Pure attention can learn spatial patterns\n\nResult:\n  Vision Transformer outperforms ResNet\n  When trained on large datasets!\nArchitecture:\nInput image (224×224×3)\n        ↓\nDivide into patches (16×16)\n        ↓\n14×14 = 196 patches\n        ↓\nEach patch: 16×16×3 = 768D\n        ↓\nLinear projection\n        ↓\n196 vectors of 768D\n        ↓\nAdd positional encoding\n(so model knows spatial position)\n        ↓\nAdd [CLS] token\n(like BERT for images)\n        ↓\nTransformer encoder (12 layers)\n        ↓\nExtract [CLS] token\n        ↓\n768D image representation\nHow it works:\nKey insight: Patches are like words\n\nIn NLP:\n  Word tokens → Transformer → Semantic relationships\n\nIn ViT:\n  Image patches → Transformer → Spatial relationships\n\nLayer 1:\n  Each patch attends to all other patches\n  Learns: Which patches are related?\n\nLayer 2-12:\n  Progressively integrate information\n  Layer 6: Coarse spatial understanding\n  Layer 12: Fine-grained semantic understanding\nWhy this works:\n\nGlobal receptive field from Layer 1\nCNN needs many layers to see globally ViT sees all patches from first layer Enables faster learning of global patterns\nFlexible to patches\nCan use any patch size Trade-off:\n\nLarger patches (32×32): Fewer tokens, less detail\nSmaller patches (8×8): More tokens, finer detail\n\nScales with data\nCNNs strong with small data (inductive biases) ViT weak with small data, strong with large\nModern datasets massive → ViT wins\n\nExample - ViT-Base vs ResNet-50:\n                ViT-Base       ResNet-50\n────────────────────────────────────\nParameters      86M            25.5M\nImageNet acc    77.9%          76%\nTraining data   1.4M+JFT      1.4M\nPre-training    224×224        1000×1000\nFine-tuning     Excellent      Good\n\nInterpretation:\n  ViT needs more data to train\n  But then performs better\n  Especially when transferring to new tasks\nAdvantages: ✓ Better scaling properties ✓ Transfers better to downstream tasks ✓ Simpler architecture (no CNN-specific tricks needed) ✓ More interpretable (attention patterns show what matters) ✓ Unified with NLP (same architecture for both)\nDisadvantages: ✗ Worse with small datasets ✗ Requires more computation than CNN equivalents ✗ Training unstable (needs careful tuning) ✗ Slower inference in some hardware\nWhen to use: - Large-scale applications - Transfer learning to new visual tasks - When computational resources abundant - When interpretability matters (attention visualization) - New research (faster progress with transformers)\nAttention visualization:\nFor each query patch, show which patches it attends to\n\nExample - Query at cat's head position:\n\nAttention heatmap:\n[   0    0    0  ]\n[   0   0.9   0.8]  (high attention to nearby patches)\n[   0    0.6   0  ]\n\nShows:\n- Model focuses on cat head region\n- Attends to surrounding patches (context)\n- Ignores background regions",

predict correct code among negatives\n\nResult:\n  Encoder learns to represent speech meaningfully\n  Ready for downstream tasks\nFine-tuning for tasks:\nTask 1: Speech Recognition (ASR)\n  Add: Linear layer for character/phoneme classification\n  Train: On (audio, transcription) pairs\n\n  Data needed: 10-100 hours labeled\n  Without pretraining: 10,000+ hours needed!\n\nTask 2: Speaker Identification\n  Add: Linear layer for speaker classification\n  Train: On (audio, speaker_id) pairs\n\nTask 3: Emotion Recognition\n  Add: Linear layer for emotion classification\n  Train: On (audio, emotion) pairs\nEmpirical results:\nWithout Wav2Vec2 pretraining:\n  ASR with 100 hours data: 25% WER (Word Error Rate)\n\nWith Wav2Vec2 pretraining:\n  ASR with 100 hours data: 10% WER\n  ASR with 10 hours data: 12% WER\n\nImprovement:\n  50% error reduction with same data\n  Or 10× less labeled data for same performance\nProperties: - 768D representation per frame - Learned from unlabeled data - Transferable across tasks - Works for any audio\nAdvantages: ✓ Leverages massive unlabeled data ✓ Strong transfer learning ✓ Handles diverse audio types ✓ Better than MFCC for complex tasks\nDisadvantages: ✗ Complex training procedure ✗ Requires large unlabeled dataset for pretraining ✗ Longer inference than MFCC\nWhen to use: - Speech recognition (SOTA approach) - Multi-speaker systems - Low-resource languages - When accuracy is critical",

Understand three levels of fusion (early, mid, late) - Implement each fusion strategy - Know when to use each approach - Combine multiple fusion methods - Handle missing modalities\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept: Combine raw or minimally processed data before any feature extraction\nProcess:\nRaw modality 1: Image pixels (224×224×3 = 150,528 values)\nRaw modality 2: Text words (50 tokens × 300D = 15,000 values)\n                ↓\n         Concatenation\n                ↓\n    Combined vector (165,528D)\n                ↓\n         Joint model (CNN/Transformer)\n                ↓\n            Prediction\nExample architecture:\nclass EarlyFusionModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_classes):\n        super().__init__()\n\n        # Combined input: 165,528D\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(165528, 4096)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(4096, 1024)\n        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(1024, num_classes)\n        self.relu = nn.ReLU()\n\n    def forward(self, image_pixels, text_embeddings):\n        # Flatten and concatenate\n        image_flat = image_pixels.reshape(image_pixels.shape[0], -1)\n        text_flat = text_embeddings.reshape(text_embeddings.shape[0], -1)\n        combined = torch.cat([image_flat, text_flat], dim=1)\n\n        # Process through network\n        x = self.relu(self.fc1(combined))\n        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))\n        out = self.fc3(x)\n\n        return out\nAnalysis:\nAdvantages: ✓ Model can learn all interactions (nothing hidden) ✓ Simple to understand ✓ In theory, powerful (can learn anything)\nDisadvantages: ✗ Extremely high dimensionality (165K features!) ✗ Serious overfitting risk with limited data ✗ Ignores modality-specific structure - CNN architectures don’t help - Text structure not leveraged - Image spatial correlations ignored ✗ Model must learn modality-specific patterns from scratch ✗ One noisy modality ruins everything ✗ No transfer learning possible (no pre-trained models)\nWhen to use: -

Result: [0.735, 0.185, 0.08]\n   → \"Likely cancer\" (73.5%)\n\n② Weighted (trust image more):\n   0.7 × Image + 0.3 × Lab\n   → \"Likely cancer\" (76.9%)\n\n③ Product (Bayesian):\n   0.85*0.62 / Z = [0.781, 0.069, 0.15]\n   → \"Likely cancer\" (78.1%)\n\nDifferent strategies give similar but slightly different results\nAdvantages of late fusion: ✓ Highest modularity ✓ Each modality completely independent ✓ Easy to add/remove modalities ✓ Handles missing modalities gracefully (just skip that classifier) ✓ Easy to debug (know which modality failed) ✓ Can use completely different model types per modality\nDisadvantages: ✗ Lost fine-grained cross-modal interactions ✗ Each modality must predict well independently ✗ Weaker modality can’t be helped by stronger one ✗ Higher computational cost (multiple full pipelines) ✗ Information not shared during training\nWhen to use: ✓ Modalities strongly independent ✓ Need robustness to missing modalities ✓ Interpretability important ✓ Modalities have very different characteristics ✓ Each modality has mature specialized model\nReal-world example - Autonomous driving:\nSensor fusion in self-driving car:\n\nCamera → Object detection → Predictions\nLIDAR → Distance measurement → Predictions\nRadar → Velocity detection → Predictions\n\nLate fusion:\n  Each sensor makes independent decision\n  \"Object at x=100m, y=50m\"\n\n  Decisions combined:\n  Average positions across sensors\n  Confidence = agreement between sensors\n\nResult: Robust detection even if one sensor fails\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary table:\n                Early

tokenizer)\n\nUnified input: [[IMG:patch_1], [IMG:patch_2], ...,\n                [TXT:word_1], [TXT:word_2], ...]\n\nModality markers: [IMG, IMG, ..., TXT, TXT, ...]\nPosition encoding: [0, 1, ..., 196, 197, 198, ...]\n\nCombined tokens + markers + positions\n        ↓\nTransformer encoder (12 layers)\n        ↓\nSelf-attention between all tokens\n(image patches attend to text, vice versa)\n        ↓\nOutput: Multimodal representations\nWhy this works:\nTransformer doesn't care about modality type\nPure attention-based fusion\nEach position (patch or token) can attend to all others\nLearns how to combine automatically\n\nExample attention pattern:\n\nWord \"red\" attends to:\n  - Red-colored image patches (high weight)\n  - Other color-related words (medium weight)\n  - Unrelated patches/words (low weight)\n\nImage patch attends to:\n  - Corresponding text description (high weight)\n  - Related patches (medium weight)\n  - Unrelated text (low weight)\n\nAll learned without explicit rules!\nExample architecture:\nclass MultimodalTransformer(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, vocab_size, hidden_dim=768, num_layers=12):\n        super().__init__()\n\n        #

self.img_token = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1, 1, hidden_dim))\n        self.txt_token = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1, 1, hidden_dim))\n\n        # Position encoding\n        self.pos_embed = nn.Embedding(1000, hidden_dim)\n\n        # Transformer\n        self.transformer = nn.TransformerEncoder(\n            nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(\n                d_model=hidden_dim,\n

num_classes)\n\n    def forward(self, images, text_ids):\n        batch_size = images.shape[0]\n\n        # Embed images (196 patches per image)\n        img_emb = self.img_embed(images)  # (batch, 196, 768)\n        img_emb = img_emb + self.img_token\n\n        # Embed text\n        txt_emb = self.txt_embed(text_ids)  # (batch, seq_len, 768)\n        txt_emb = txt_emb + self.txt_token\n\n        # Concatenate\n        combined = torch.cat([img_emb, txt_emb], dim=1)\n\n        # Add positional encoding\n        seq_len = combined.shape[1]\n        pos_ids = torch.arange(seq_len, device=combined.device)\n        pos_enc = self.pos_embed(pos_ids).unsqueeze(0)\n        combined = combined + pos_enc\n\n        # Transformer\n        out = self.transformer(combined)\n\n        # Use first token (like BERT [CLS]) for classification\n        cls_out = out[:, 0, :]\n        logits = self.classifier(cls_out)\n\n        return logits\nAdvantages: ✓ Unified architecture ✓ Automatic cross-modal fusion ✓ Scales well ✓ Flexible (add any modality) ✓ State-of-the-art performance\nDisadvantages: ✗ More complex ✗ Slower inference ✗ Needs careful tuning\n\n\n\nReal-world challenge:\nTraining: All modalities present\nDeployment:\n  Sometimes only image available\n  Sometimes only text available\n  Rarely all modalities together\n\nExample scenarios:\n\nE-commerce system:\n  Training: 1M products with image + description + reviews\n  At test time:\n    Product A: Image only (video unavailable)\n    Product B: Text only (image not loading)\n    Product C: All modalities\n\nMedical system:\n  Training: Patients with CT + MRI + blood tests\n  At test time:\n    Patient A: Only CT scan (MRI machine broken)\n    Patient B: CT + blood (MRI not done)\n    Patient C: All three\n\n\nApproach: Train separate models for each modality and combinations\nclass MultimodalClassifier:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.img_only_model =

is not None:\n            # Only text\n            return self.txt_only_model.predict(text)\nAdvantages: ✓ Simple and modular ✓ Good performance per modality ✓ Easy to add modalities\nDisadvantages: ✗ Requires training multiple models ✗ Duplication of effort ✗ Inconsistent predictions (models disagree)\n\n\n\nApproach: Learn which modalities to trust based on availability\nclass

     logits = self.classifier(fused)\n\n        return logits\nHow it works: - Gate networks learn importance of each modality - During training: All modalities penalize equally (gates = 1) - Some modalities learned as less important (gates &lt; 1) - At test time: Missing modalities handled gracefully (gate = 0)\nAdvantages: ✓ Single model ✓ Learns to trust modalities ✓ Handles missing data\nDisadvantages: ✗ More complex training ✗ Potential numerical issues (zeros in features)\n\n\n\nApproach: Predict missing modalities from available ones\nclass ImputingFusionModel(nn.Module):\n

missing: Predict from image - If image missing: Predict from text - Use predictions as if real\nAdvantages: ✓ Single model ✓ Predictions fill in gaps ✓ Cross-modal knowledge transfer\nDisadvantages: ✗

    "text": "Previous: How to Use This Book | Next: Chapter 2: Foundations and Core Concepts | Home: Table of Contents\n\n\n\nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to: - Define multimodality and multimodal learning - Explain why multimodal learning is important - Identify the three key characteristics of multimodal data - Understand different types of multimodal tasks - Recognize the main challenges in multimodal systems\n\n\n\n\n\nMultimodal learning refers to machine learning systems that can process and integrate information from multiple modalities (distinct types of data or information channels) to make predictions, understand content, or generate new information.\nA modality is any distinct channel through which information can be conveyed. In machine learning, common modalities include:\n\nVisual (images, videos)\nLinguistic (text, written language)\nAcoustic (audio, speech)\nSensory (touch, smell, motion)\nStructured (tables, graphs, numerical data)\n\n\n\n\nConsider how you watch a movie:\nVisual Information    → Colors, movements, objects, faces\n    ↓                 ↓\n    └─→ [Brain Integration] ←─┘\n    ↑                 ↑\nAuditory Information  → Dialogue, music, sound effects\nYour brain seamlessly combines: - What you see - Characters, settings, expressions - What you hear - Dialogue, tone, music, emotional cues - What you know - Context, expectations, memories\nResult: A rich, cohesive understanding of what’s happening.\nThis is the goal of multimodal AI—to enable machines to integrate information the way humans naturally do.\n\n\n\nText Only Approach:\nPrompt: \"What happened?\"\nProblem: Highly ambiguous (good event? bad event?)\nInformation is incomplete\nImage Only Approach:\nImage: [Photo of a cat]\nProblem: No context about who, what, when, why\nInformation is incomplete\nText + Image Combined:\nText: \"This is an adorable cat\"\nImage: [Photo of a cute cat]\nResult: Both modalities confirm each other\nUnderstanding is complete and accurate\nThe Power of Multimodality: Different modalities provide complementary information that together creates a richer understanding than either modality alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral factors make this the right time for multimodal learning:\n1. Data Availability - Billions of image-caption pairs online (from web scraping) - Millions of videos with audio and subtitles - Text documents with embedded images and charts - Unprecedented scale of multimodal data\n2. Computational Progress - GPU/TPU capabilities enable larger models - Efficient algorithms reduce computational requirements - Large-scale training now feasible\n3. Algorithmic Breakthroughs - Transformer architecture (2017) - unified processing - Contrastive learning (2020) - learn from unlabeled data - Attention mechanisms - connect modalities effectively\n4. Real-World Demand - Content recommendation needs multimodal understanding - Accessibility requires converting between modalities - E-commerce needs image-text matching - Autonomous vehicles need multiple sensors\n5. Foundation Models - Large language models (GPT, BERT) pre-trained and transferable - Vision models (ViT, ResNet) proven effective - Combining these enables multimodal systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nAchievement\nImpact\n\n\n\n\n2014\nNeural Image Captioning\nFirst deep learning approach to connect vision and language\n\n\n2017\nTransformer Architecture\nUnified architecture enabling multimodal processing\n\n\n2019\nViLBERT\nJoint vision-language pre-training at scale\n\n\n2021\nCLIP\nContrastive learning with 400M image-text pairs - breakthrough zero-shot transfer\n\n\n2021\nDALL-E\nText-to-image generation demonstration\n\n\n2022\nMultimodal LLMs\nGPT-4V, LLaVA - large language models processing images\n\n\n2023\nGenerative Multimodal\nWidespread adoption of image/video generation\n\n\n2024\nFoundation Multimodal Models\nGPT-4V, Claude 3, Gemini - unified multimodal understanding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding these characteristics is essential for designing effective multimodal systems.\n\n\nDefinition: Different modalities provide different dimensions of information that enhance overall understanding.\nExample - Medical Diagnosis:\nCT Scan Image:\n  └─ Shows physical structure (tumors, growths, densities)\n     └─ Helps identify abnormalities in tissue\n\nDoctor's Text Notes:\n  └─ Describes symptoms, patient history, observations\n     └─ Explains clinical significance\n\nCombined:\n  └─ Physical findings + clinical context\n     └─ More accurate diagnosis than either alone\nWhy it matters: - Images excel at capturing spatial/visual patterns - Text excels at semantic meaning and abstract concepts - Together they create comprehensive understanding\nChallenge created: - Must preserve information from both modalities - Cannot reduce one to the other\n\n\n\nDefinition: Information from different modalities often overlaps, providing confirmation and robustness.\nExample - Speech Recognition:\nAudio Channel:\n  \"Hello\" → acoustic signal representation\n\nLip Reading Channel:\n  [Lip movement pattern] → visual representation of same phoneme\n\nRedundancy benefit:\n  If audio noisy, lip reading helps\n  If lighting poor for lip reading, audio is clear\n  Combined: Very robust speech recognition\nWhy it matters: - Redundancy seems wasteful but is actually valuable - Provides verification across modalities - Increases system robustness and reliability\nReal-world application - Autonomous Driving:\nCamera → Sees lane markings and traffic signs\nLIDAR → Detects road boundaries through light\nRadar → Detects moving vehicles\n\nRedundancy benefit:\n  If one sensor fails, others compensate\n  If one is confused, others clarify\n  System remains safe and operational\nChallenge created: - Cannot simply average or concatenate modalities - Need intelligent fusion that leverages complementarity while handling redundancy\n\n\n\nDefinition: Different modalities have fundamentally different data structures, dimensionalities, and distributions.\nComparison of Common Modalities:\nIMAGE FEATURES (from ResNet):\n  Dimensionality:    High (2,048 dimensions)\n  Data type:         Continuous values\n  Range:             [0, 1] or [-1, 1]\n  Structure:         2D spatial grid\n  Property:          Highly redundant\n  Sample size:       2KB per 224×224 image\n\nTEXT FEATURES (from BERT):\n  Dimensionality:    Medium (768 dimensions)\n  Data type:         Discrete symbols or continuous vectors\n  Range:             Variable\n  Structure:         1D sequence\n  Property:          Sparse and symbolic\n  Sample size:       Few bytes to kilobytes\n\nAUDIO FEATURES (from Wav2Vec):\n  Dimensionality:    Medium (768 dimensions)\n  Data type:         Continuous values\n  Range:             [-1, 1]\n  Structure:         1D temporal sequence\n  Property:          High sampling rate\n  Sample size:       Megabytes for minutes of audio\nThe Heterogeneity Problem:\nCore Challenge:\n\nImage vector: [0.5, -0.2, 0.8, ...] (2048 numbers)\nText vector:  [0.3, 0.1, -0.5, ...] (768 numbers)\n\nThese come from completely different spaces!\nCannot directly compare them!\n\nAnalogy:\n  Image like measuring \"temperature\" (in Fahrenheit)\n  Text like measuring \"distance\" (in meters)\n\n  Can you directly compare 73°F and 10 meters?\n  No! They're different types of quantities.\nWhy it matters: - Each modality needs appropriate preprocessing - Different architectures may be optimal for each - Fusion must bridge these fundamental differences\nChallenges it creates: 1. Dimensionality mismatch - How to compare vectors of different sizes? 2. Distribution mismatch - How to fuse values with different ranges and distributions? 3. Structural differences - How to handle different temporal/spatial structures? 4. Type differences - How to combine discrete symbols with continuous values?\nSolutions required: - Find common representation space (alignment) - Learn transformation functions (projections) - Use intelligent fusion strategies\n\n\n\n\nMultimodal tasks can be categorized by whether they involve understanding or generation.\n\n\nTask Definition: Given multimodal input, make a prediction or extract information.\n\n\nProblem: Given an image or text query, find the most similar items of other modality\nReal-world applications: - Google Images search - Pinterest visual search - E-commerce product discovery - Asset management systems\nExample:\nUser Input (Text): \"Girl wearing red dress\"\nSystem Output: [\n  Image1: young woman in red dress,\n  Image2: girl in red evening gown,\n  Image3: child in red costume,\n  ...\n]\nChallenges: - Need to understand semantic meaning of both text and images - Must align them in common space - Ranking matters (top-K retrieval)\nTypical metrics: - Recall@K (did correct match appear in top K results?) - Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)\n\n\n\nProblem: Given an image and a question (text), generate an answer (text)\nReal-world applications: - Accessibility technology for blind users - Medical image interpretation - Autonomous systems understanding scenes - Content verification\nExample:\nInput Image: [Bedroom photo]\nInput Question: \"What's on the bed?\"\nOutput: \"A sleeping cat and a teddy bear\"\nChallenges: - Understand image content - Parse question requirements - Reason about relationships - Generate coherent answer\nPopular datasets: - VQA v2.0 (204K images, 11M QA pairs) - GQA (113K scenes) - OK-VQA (outside knowledge required)\n\n\n\nProblem: Determine sentiment from combined image, text, and/or audio\nReal-world applications: - Social media monitoring - Brand sentiment analysis - Market research - Content moderation\nExample:\nSocial Media Post:\n  Image: [Happy face photo]\n  Text: \"I love this!\"\n  Audio: [Upbeat voice tone]\n\nOutput: Positive sentiment (high confidence)\nReasoning: All modalities align (happy face, positive words, upbeat tone)\nComplexity: - Sarcasm detection (text says good, audio/face says bad) - Modality conflicts - Cultural differences in expression\n\n\n\nProblem: Classify or describe video content (combines visual, audio, temporal)\nReal-world applications: - Video recommendation systems - Content moderation - Automatic video tagging - Sports analytics\nExample:\nInput: [Basketball game video with commentary]\nOutput: \"Three-point shot\" or \"Fast break\"\nChallenges: - Temporal understanding (when does action occur?) - Audio-visual synchronization - Complex event recognition - Summarization\n\n\n\nProblem: Extract information from documents containing images, tables, and text\nReal-world applications: - Invoice processing for finance - Receipt recognition for expense tracking - Form filling automation - Academic paper understanding\nExample:\nInput: [Scanned invoice image]\nOutput: {\n  \"vendor\": \"ABC Corp\",\n  \"amount\": \"$1,000.50\",\n  \"date\": \"2024-01-15\",\n  \"line_items\": [...]\n}\n\n\n\n\nTask Definition: Given one or more modalities as input, generate another modality.\n\n\nProblem: Given an image, generate descriptive text\nReal-world applications: - Accessibility (describing images for blind users) - Image annotation - Visual search - Content management\nExample:\nInput Image: [Cat on windowsill]\nOutput: \"A gray tabby cat sits peacefully on a sunny windowsill,\n         looking out at the garden below.\"\nChallenges: - Capture important objects and relationships - Generate grammatically correct sentences - Match level of detail to context - Handle variations in valid captions\nKey metrics: - BLEU (similarity to reference captions) -

DALL-E, Midjourney (content creation) - Design tools - Data augmentation - Art generation\nExample:\nInput Text: \"A cat wearing a spacesuit on the moon\"\nOutput: [Generated image of cat in space]\nComplexity: - Massive output space (infinite valid images) - Must handle fine details in text - Generate coherent, realistic images - Handle ambiguous descriptions\nTypical approach: - Use diffusion models for generation - Text encoder to understand description - Iterative refinement (text → low-res → high-res)\n\n\n\nProblem: Generate text description of video content\nReal-world applications: - YouTube automatic subtitles - Accessibility for deaf/hard-of-hearing - Video search and indexing - Content summarization\nExample:\nInput: [5-second video of person making coffee]\nOutput: \"A person pours hot water from a kettle into a coffee filter,\n         then waits as the coffee drips into a white mug.\"\nChallenges: - Temporal structure (what happens when?) - Multiple events to describe - Temporal relationships (before, after, during) - Summarization (what’s important?)\n\n\n\nProblem: Generate audio speech from text (Text-to-Speech, TTS)\nReal-world applications: - Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa) - Audiobook generation - Accessibility for blind users - Language learning\nExample:\nInput: \"Hello world\" + speaker_id: \"female_british\"\nOutput: [Audio of woman with British accent saying \"Hello world\"]\nConsiderations: - Natural prosody and intonation - Speaker characteristics - Multiple language support - Emotion expression in voice\n\n\n\nProblem: Answer questions about images in longer form (paragraphs instead of single answer)\nReal-world applications: - Image understanding systems - Medical report generation from scans - Scene description for accessibility - Educational explanations\nExample:\nInput Image: [Scene with multiple people and animals]\nInput Question: \"Describe everything you see in detail\"\n\nOutput: \"In a sunny outdoor setting, three people are gathered\n         around a small petting zoo area. To the left, a child\n         is feeding a goat with a bottle of milk. Behind them,\n         two adults supervise, smiling. On the right side,\n         a llama and two sheep graze peacefully. In the background,\n         you can see mountains and green grass.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding these challenges is crucial for designing effective systems.\n\n\nThe Problem:\nDifferent modalities have fundamentally different characteristics:\nImage Feature Space:        Text Feature Space:\nHigh-dimensional (2048D)    Lower-dimensional (768D)\nContinuous values           Discrete or continuous\nSpatial structure           Temporal/sequential structure\nDense representations       Sparse representations\n\nHow to compare or combine?\n→ Must find common ground\nSpecific Issues:\n\nDimensionality mismatch\nImage vector: 2048 dimensions\nText vector: 768 dimensions\n\nCannot directly compare!\nCosine similarity between different-size vectors is meaningless\nDistribution mismatch\nImage values: Typically normalized to [-1, 1]\nText values: Can be very large positive/negative numbers\n\nSame numerical operation (e.g., addition) has different effects\nSemantic mismatch\nWhat does image value of 0.5 mean? (partial feature activation)\nWhat does text value of 0.5 mean? (word embedding component)\n\nThese are incommensurable!\n\nSolution Approach:\nCreate a shared representation space:\nImage → Projection Matrix → Shared Space (256D)\n                    ↑\n                    └─ Both now comparable!\n\nText → Projection Matrix → Shared Space (256D)\nResearch implications: - How to choose shared space dimension? - What properties should shared space have? - Can we learn projections jointly?\n\n\n\nThe Problem:\nHow do we know which image matches which text?\nSimple Example:\nImages:        Texts:\nImage1.jpg     \"A black cat sitting on a chair\"\nImage2.jpg     \"A golden retriever running in park\"\nImage3.jpg\nImage4.jpg\n\nQuestion: Which images correspond to which texts?\nComplexity Levels:\nLEVEL 1 - Coarse-grained alignment:\n  Entire image ↔ Entire text description\n  Example: [Product photo] ↔ \"Product description paragraph\"\n\nLEVEL 2 - Fine-grained alignment:\n  Image regions ↔ Text phrases\n  Example: [Cat's head region] ↔ \"orange tabby cat\"\n\nLEVEL 3 - Very fine-grained:\n  Image pixels ↔ Text words\n  Used in dense video captioning with timestamps\nWhy Alignment is Hard:\n\nOne-to-many mappings\nOne image can have many valid descriptions:\nImage: [Cat on bed]\n\nValid captions:\n- \"A cat is on a bed\"\n- \"A sleeping cat\"\n- \"A comfortable cat rests\"\n- \"Feline on furniture\"\n\nAll are correct! Model must handle this.\nMissing explicit pairing\nWeb data often has images near text, but not paired:\n\nWebsite article:\n[Image1]\n[Image2]\n[Long paragraph mentioning both]\n[Image3]\n\nChallenge: Figure out which text matches which image\nWeak supervision\nImage: [People at beach]\nText: \"Best vacation ever!\"\n\nProblem: Text doesn't directly describe image\nStill contains useful signal though!\n\n\n\n\nThe Problem:\nDifferent modalities sometimes contradict each other.\nExample - E-commerce:\nProduct Image: Shows RED object\nProduct Text: \"This item comes in BLUE\"\n\nWhich is correct?\n→ Both could be true (product comes in multiple colors)\n→ Or one source is wrong\n→ Or image is outdated\nSophisticated Example - News Articles:\nImage: [Peaceful protest scene]\nHeadline: \"Violent riots erupt downtown\"\n\nPossible explanations:\n1. Image is misleading (selective framing)\n2. Headline is incorrect or sensationalized\n3. Image from different event\n4. Caption mismatch\nReal-world consequences:\nSocial media analysis:\n  Happy face photo + \"I hate my life\" + Sad audio tone\n  All three modalities conflict\n\nMedical diagnosis:\n  CT scan shows \"no abnormality\"\n  Patient notes say \"severe pain\"\n  Doctor must reconcile\n\nFinancial fraud detection:\n  Receipt image shows \"$100\"\n  System notes show \"$10,000\"\n\nThese conflicts matter!\nHow to Handle:\n\nConfidence-based - Trust modality with higher confidence\nContext-aware - Different tasks trust different modalities\nExplicit detection - Flag conflicts for human review\nLearned weights - Let model learn which modality is trustworthy\n\n\n\n\nThe Problem:\nReal-world systems often have incomplete data.\nExample Scenarios:\nSCENARIO 1 - E-commerce:\n  Training data: Product image + description + price\n  User input: Only description (no image available)\n  System must still work\n\nSCENARIO 2 - Video platform:\n  Training data: Video with audio + captions\n  User upload: Silent video (no audio, no captions)\n  System must process\n\nSCENARIO 3 - Medical:\n  Training data: CT scan + ultrasound + X-ray + blood tests\n  Patient input: Only CT scan available\n  Diagnosis must proceed\nWhy This Happens:\n\nSensors fail or are unavailable\nUser doesn’t provide all information\nData collection incomplete\nPrivacy restrictions prevent data sharing\nCost constraints (some modalities expensive)\n\nSolutions:\n\nModality-agnostic learning\n\nTrain each modality independently\nCan work with any subset\nBut loses cross-modality benefits\n\nModality prediction/imputation\n\nPredict missing modality from others\nCan introduce errors\nBut enables joint learning\n\nAdaptive fusion\n\nAutomatically adjust based on available modalities\nMore sophisticated\nBetter performance\nMore complex implementation\n\n\nExample of Graceful Degradation:\nAll modalities (image + text + audio):\n  ✓ Understand scene\n  ✓ Caption image\n  ✓ Recognize speaker\n\nImage + text only:\n  ✓ Understand scene\n  ✓ Caption image\n  ✗ No speaker recognition\n\nText only:\n  ✓ Simple command processing\n  ✗ No visual understanding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: Extract meaning from multimodal input\nApplications: - Medical Diagnosis - Combine imaging, patient history, test results - Autonomous Driving - Fuse camera, LIDAR, radar data - Content Moderation - Understand images, text, audio together - Search and Retrieval - Find relevant content across modalities\n\n\n\nGoal: Create new content in one or more modalities\nApplications: - AI Art Generation - DALL-E, Midjourney (text → image) - Video Generation - Generate videos from descriptions - Content Authoring - Help create documents with images - Accessibility - Generate audio descriptions of images\n\n\n\nGoal: Convert information from one modality to another while preserving meaning\nApplications: - Image Captioning - Convert visual → linguistic - Speech Recognition - Convert acoustic → linguistic - Audio Description - Convert visual → linguistic (detailed) - Transcription - Audio → text (speech-to-text)\n\n\n\nGoal: Enable natural human-AI interaction across modalities\nApplications: - Multimodal Chatbots - Process text, images, audio - Virtual Assistants - Siri, Alexa with multiple input types - AR/VR Systems - Combine visual and spatial data - Sign Language Recognition - Convert sign → text\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLIP (OpenAI, 2021)\n├─ Purpose: Image-text alignment\n├─ Size: 400M parameters\n└─ Impact: Foundation for zero-shot vision\n\nBLIP-2 (Salesforce, 2023)\n├─ Purpose: Parameter-efficient multimodal learning\n├─ Size: 14M trainable parameters\n└─ Impact: Efficient adaptation with LLMs\n\nLLaVA (Microsoft, 2023)\n├─ Purpose: Large multimodal instruction tuner\n├─ Size: 7B-13B parameters\n└─ Impact: Instruction-following multimodal\n\nStable Diffusion (RunwayML, 2022)\n├─ Purpose: Text-to-image generation\n├─ Size: 1B parameters\n└─ Impact: Democratized image generation\n\n\n\nGPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023)\n├─ Purpose: Universal multimodal understanding\n├─ Capabilities: Images, text, reasoning\n└─ Impact: AGI-adjacent multimodal system\n\nClaude 3 (Anthropic, 2024)\n├─ Purpose: Multimodal reasoning and understanding\n├─ Capabilities: Images, complex reasoning\n└─ Impact: Improved interpretability in multimodal\n\nGemini (Google, 2024)\n├─ Purpose: Truly multimodal foundation model\n├─ Capabilities: Text, images, audio, video\n└─ Impact: End-to-end multimodal processing\n\n\n\n\nThis book progresses from foundations to applications:\nPART I: FOUNDATIONS\n├─ Chapter 1: Introduction (this chapter)\n├─ Chapter 2: Core Concepts and Challenges\n└─ Chapter 3: Single-Modality Representations\n\nPART II: CORE TECHNIQUES\n├─ Chapter 4: Alignment and Bridging\n├─ Chapter 5: Fusion Strategies\n├─ Chapter 6: Attention Mechanisms\n└─ Chapter 7: Contrastive Learning\n\nPART III: ARCHITECTURE AND GENERATION\n├─ Chapter 8: Transformer Deep-Dive\n└─ Chapter 9: Generative Models\n\nPART IV: PRACTICE AND APPLICATION\n├─ Chapter 10: Seminal Models\n├─ Chapter 11: Implementation Guide\n└─ Chapter 12: Advanced Topics and Research\n\n\n\n\nMultimodality reflects reality -

    "text": "Multimodal learning refers to machine learning systems that can process and integrate information from multiple modalities (distinct types of data or information channels) to make predictions, understand content, or generate new information.\nA modality is any distinct channel through which information can be conveyed. In machine learning, common modalities include:\n\nVisual (images, videos)\nLinguistic (text, written language)\nAcoustic (audio, speech)\nSensory (touch, smell, motion)\nStructured (tables, graphs, numerical data)\n\n\n\n\nConsider how you watch a movie:\nVisual Information    → Colors, movements, objects, faces\n    ↓                 ↓\n    └─→ [Brain Integration] ←─┘\n    ↑                 ↑\nAuditory Information  → Dialogue, music, sound effects\nYour brain seamlessly combines: - What you see - Characters, settings, expressions - What you hear - Dialogue, tone, music, emotional cues - What you know - Context, expectations, memories\nResult: A rich, cohesive understanding of what’s happening.\nThis is the goal of multimodal AI—to enable machines to integrate information the way humans naturally do.\n\n\n\nText Only Approach:\nPrompt: \"What happened?\"\nProblem: Highly ambiguous (good event? bad event?)\nInformation is incomplete\nImage Only Approach:\nImage: [Photo of a cat]\nProblem: No context about who, what, when, why\nInformation is incomplete\nText + Image Combined:\nText: \"This is an adorable cat\"\nImage: [Photo of a cute cat]\nResult: Both modalities confirm each other\nUnderstanding is complete and accurate\nThe Power of Multimodality: Different modalities provide complementary information that together creates a richer understanding than either modality alone.",

    "text": "Understanding these characteristics is essential for designing effective multimodal systems.\n\n\nDefinition: Different modalities provide different dimensions of information that enhance overall understanding.\nExample - Medical Diagnosis:\nCT Scan Image:\n  └─ Shows physical structure (tumors, growths, densities)\n     └─ Helps identify abnormalities in tissue\n\nDoctor's Text Notes:\n  └─ Describes symptoms, patient history, observations\n     └─ Explains clinical significance\n\nCombined:\n  └─ Physical findings + clinical context\n     └─ More accurate diagnosis than either alone\nWhy it matters: - Images excel at capturing spatial/visual patterns - Text excels at semantic meaning and abstract concepts - Together they create comprehensive understanding\nChallenge created: - Must preserve information from both modalities - Cannot reduce one to the other\n\n\n\nDefinition: Information from different modalities often overlaps, providing confirmation and robustness.\nExample - Speech Recognition:\nAudio Channel:\n  \"Hello\" → acoustic signal representation\n\nLip Reading Channel:\n  [Lip movement pattern] → visual representation of same phoneme\n\nRedundancy benefit:\n  If audio noisy, lip reading helps\n  If lighting poor for lip reading, audio is clear\n  Combined: Very robust speech recognition\nWhy it matters: - Redundancy seems wasteful but is actually valuable - Provides verification across modalities - Increases system robustness and reliability\nReal-world application - Autonomous Driving:\nCamera → Sees lane markings and traffic signs\nLIDAR → Detects road boundaries through light\nRadar → Detects moving vehicles\n\nRedundancy benefit:\n  If one sensor fails, others compensate\n  If one is confused, others clarify\n  System remains safe and operational\nChallenge created: - Cannot simply average or concatenate modalities - Need intelligent fusion that leverages complementarity while handling redundancy\n\n\n\nDefinition: Different modalities have fundamentally different data structures, dimensionalities, and distributions.\nComparison of Common Modalities:\nIMAGE FEATURES (from ResNet):\n  Dimensionality:    High (2,048 dimensions)\n  Data type:         Continuous values\n  Range:             [0, 1] or [-1, 1]\n  Structure:         2D spatial grid\n  Property:          Highly redundant\n  Sample size:       2KB per 224×224 image\n\nTEXT FEATURES (from BERT):\n  Dimensionality:    Medium (768 dimensions)\n  Data type:         Discrete symbols or continuous vectors\n  Range:             Variable\n  Structure:         1D sequence\n  Property:          Sparse and symbolic\n  Sample size:       Few bytes to kilobytes\n\nAUDIO FEATURES (from Wav2Vec):\n  Dimensionality:    Medium (768 dimensions)\n  Data type:         Continuous values\n  Range:             [-1, 1]\n  Structure:         1D temporal sequence\n  Property:          High sampling rate\n  Sample size:       Megabytes for minutes of audio\nThe Heterogeneity Problem:\nCore Challenge:\n\nImage vector: [0.5, -0.2, 0.8, ...] (2048 numbers)\nText vector:  [0.3, 0.1, -0.5, ...] (768 numbers)\n\nThese come from completely different spaces!\nCannot directly compare them!\n\nAnalogy:\n  Image like measuring \"temperature\" (in Fahrenheit)\n  Text like measuring \"distance\" (in meters)\n\n  Can you directly compare 73°F and 10 meters?\n  No! They're different types of quantities.\nWhy it matters: - Each modality needs appropriate preprocessing - Different architectures may be optimal for each - Fusion must bridge these fundamental differences\nChallenges it creates: 1. Dimensionality mismatch - How to compare vectors of different sizes? 2. Distribution mismatch - How to fuse values with different ranges and distributions? 3. Structural differences - How to handle different temporal/spatial structures? 4. Type differences - How to combine discrete symbols with continuous values?\nSolutions required: - Find common representation space (alignment) - Learn transformation functions (projections) - Use intelligent fusion strategies",

(word embedding component)\n\nThese are incommensurable!\n\nSolution Approach:\nCreate a shared representation space:\nImage → Projection Matrix → Shared Space (256D)\n                    ↑\n                    └─ Both now comparable!\n\nText → Projection Matrix → Shared Space (256D)\nResearch implications: - How to choose shared space dimension? - What properties should shared space have? - Can we learn projections jointly?\n\n\n\nThe Problem:\nHow do we know which image matches which text?\nSimple Example:\nImages:        Texts:\nImage1.jpg     \"A black cat sitting on a chair\"\nImage2.jpg     \"A golden retriever running in park\"\nImage3.jpg\nImage4.jpg\n\nQuestion: Which images correspond to which texts?\nComplexity Levels:\nLEVEL 1 - Coarse-grained alignment:\n  Entire image ↔ Entire text description\n  Example: [Product photo] ↔ \"Product description paragraph\"\n\nLEVEL 2 - Fine-grained alignment:\n  Image regions ↔ Text phrases\n  Example: [Cat's head region] ↔ \"orange tabby cat\"\n\nLEVEL 3 - Very fine-grained:\n  Image pixels ↔ Text words\n  Used in dense video captioning with timestamps\nWhy Alignment is Hard:\n\nOne-to-many mappings\nOne image can have many valid descriptions:\nImage: [Cat on bed]\n\nValid captions:\n- \"A cat is on a bed\"\n- \"A sleeping cat\"\n- \"A comfortable cat rests\"\n- \"Feline on furniture\"\n\nAll are correct! Model must handle this.\nMissing explicit pairing\nWeb data often has images near text, but not paired:\n\nWebsite article:\n[Image1]\n[Image2]\n[Long paragraph mentioning both]\n[Image3]\n\nChallenge: Figure out which text matches which image\nWeak supervision\nImage: [People at beach]\nText: \"Best vacation ever!\"\n\nProblem: Text doesn't directly describe image\nStill contains useful signal though!\n\n\n\n\nThe Problem:\nDifferent modalities sometimes contradict each other.\nExample - E-commerce:\nProduct Image: Shows RED object\nProduct Text: \"This item comes in BLUE\"\n\nWhich is correct?\n→ Both could be true (product comes in multiple colors)\n→ Or one source is wrong\n→ Or image is outdated\nSophisticated Example - News Articles:\nImage: [Peaceful protest scene]\nHeadline: \"Violent riots erupt downtown\"\n\nPossible explanations:\n1. Image is misleading (selective framing)\n2. Headline is incorrect or sensationalized\n3. Image from different event\n4. Caption mismatch\nReal-world consequences:\nSocial media analysis:\n  Happy face photo + \"I hate my life\" + Sad audio tone\n  All three modalities conflict\n\nMedical diagnosis:\n  CT scan shows \"no abnormality\"\n  Patient notes say \"severe pain\"\n  Doctor must reconcile\n\nFinancial fraud detection:\n  Receipt image shows \"$100\"\n  System notes show \"$10,000\"\n\nThese conflicts matter!\nHow to Handle:\n\nConfidence-based - Trust modality with higher confidence\nContext-aware - Different tasks trust different modalities\nExplicit detection - Flag conflicts for human review\nLearned weights - Let model learn which modality is trustworthy\n\n\n\n\nThe Problem:\nReal-world systems often have incomplete data.\nExample Scenarios:\nSCENARIO 1 - E-commerce:\n  Training data: Product image + description + price\n  User input: Only description (no image available)\n  System must still work\n\nSCENARIO 2 - Video platform:\n  Training data: Video with audio + captions\n  User upload: Silent video (no audio, no captions)\n  System must process\n\nSCENARIO 3 - Medical:\n  Training data: CT scan + ultrasound + X-ray + blood tests\n  Patient input: Only CT scan available\n  Diagnosis must proceed\nWhy This Happens:\n\nSensors fail or are unavailable\nUser doesn’t provide all information\nData collection incomplete\nPrivacy restrictions prevent data sharing\nCost constraints (some modalities expensive)\n\nSolutions:\n\nModality-agnostic learning\n\nTrain each modality independently\nCan work with any subset\nBut loses cross-modality benefits\n\nModality prediction/imputation\n\nPredict missing modality from others\nCan introduce errors\nBut enables joint learning\n\nAdaptive fusion\n\nAutomatically adjust based on available modalities\nMore sophisticated\nBetter performance\nMore complex implementation\n\n\nExample of Graceful Degradation:\nAll modalities (image + text + audio):\n  ✓ Understand scene\n  ✓ Caption image\n  ✓ Recognize speaker\n\nImage + text only:\n  ✓ Understand scene\n  ✓ Caption image\n  ✗ No speaker recognition\n\nText only:\n  ✓ Simple command processing\n  ✗ No visual understanding",

    "text": "Previous: Chapter 3: Feature Representation for Each Modality | Next: Chapter 5: Fusion Strategies | Home: Table of Contents\n\n\n\nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to: - Understand why alignment is necessary - Implement shared embedding spaces - Use cross-attention for fine-grained alignment - Handle bidirectional alignment - Solve alignment in practice\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Core Challenge:\nImage features: 2048-dimensional vector (from ResNet)\nText features: 768-dimensional vector (from BERT)\n\nQuestion: How similar are they?\n\nProblem:\n  ✗ Different dimensions (can't directly compare)\n  ✗ Different scales (0-1 for text, -infinity to infinity for images)\n  ✗ Different semantics (what does dimension 500 mean in each?)\n  ✗ No natural similarity metric\n\nWe need: ALIGNMENT\nGoal: Make image and text features \"understand\" each other\nReal-world consequence:\nApplication: Image-text search\n  User searches: \"red cat\"\n  System has: 10 million images + descriptions\n\nWithout alignment:\n  Can't compare image and text vectors\n  Search impossible\n\nWith alignment:\n  Image vectors and text vectors in same space\n  Similarity computed easily\n  Search works!\n\n\n\nLevel 1: Coarse-grained (Document-level)\nEntire image ↔ Entire text description\n\nExample:\n  Image: [Full photo of cat on chair]\n  Text: \"A tabby cat relaxing on a wooden chair\"\n\n  Alignment: Image matches entire text\n\nUse cases:\n  - Image-text retrieval\n  - Image classification with descriptions\n  - Document understanding (image + caption)\n\nChallenge: Image might have multiple objects\n           Text mentions most important ones\nLevel 2: Fine-grained (Region-level)\nImage regions ↔ Text phrases\n\nExample:\n  Image regions:\n    Region 1: [Cat's head area]\n    Region 2: [Chair seat area]\n    Region 3: [Background]\n\n  Text phrases:\n    \"tabby cat\" ↔ Region 1\n    \"wooden chair\" ↔ Region 2\n    \"cozy room\" ↔ Region 3\n\nUse cases:\n  - Visual question answering (where are things?)\n  - Dense image captioning\n  - Object detection with descriptions\n  - Grounding language in images\n\nChallenge: Multiple valid region boundaries\n           Phrases don't perfectly correspond to regions\nLevel 3: Very Fine-grained (Pixel/Token-level)\nImage pixels ↔ Text tokens\n\nExample:\n  Video frame:\n    [Pixels 100-200]: Red fur\n    [Pixels 500-600]: Cat's eye\n    [Pixels 800-900]: Chair texture\n\n  Text tokens:\n    \"red\" ↔ Red fur pixels\n    \"cat\" ↔ Cat structure pixels\n    \"chair\" ↔ Chair pixels\n\nUse cases:\n  - Semantic segmentation with text\n  - Dense video captioning with timestamps\n  - Pixel-level understanding with descriptions\n\nChallenge: Extremely fine-grained\n           Requires pixel-level annotations\n           Computationally expensive\n\n\n\nReason 1: One-to-many mappings\nSingle image can have many valid descriptions:\n\nImage: [Cat on bed]\n\nValid descriptions:\n  ① \"A cat is sleeping on a bed\"\n  ② \"A cat on a bed\"\n  ③ \"Feline on furniture\"\n  ④ \"A cozy cat\"\n  ⑤ \"Kitty resting\"\n\nAll correct!\nNo single \"ground truth\" alignment\n\nChallenge: How to learn from multiple valid targets?\nSolution: Use soft targets or ranking-based losses\nReason 2: Implicit pairing in training data\nWeb data structure:\n\n[Article with title: \"Beautiful pets\"]\n│\n├─ [Image 1]\n├─ [Image 2]\n├─ [Large paragraph mentioning pets]\n├─ [Image 3]\n└─ [Image 4]\n\nChallenge:\n  Which image goes with which sentence?\n  Are all images described equally?\n\nSolutions:\n  - Assume images near text match it\n  - Learn implicit pairings\n  - Use weak supervision signals\nReason 3: Semantic gaps\nImage and text express different aspects:\n\nImage: \"Tabby cat, orange color, on blue chair, sunny room\"\nText: \"A cat resting\"\n\nText is abstract summary\nImage is concrete visual\n\nHow to align?\n  Need to map concrete visual features\n  to abstract semantic concepts\n\nThis requires:\n  ① Understanding visual features\n  ② Understanding text semantics\n  ③ Bridging the gap\nReason 4: Missing or corrupted data\nData quality issues:\n\nSituation 1: Image and text don't match\n  Image: [Car]\n  Text: \"Beautiful sunset\"\n\n  Alignment should recognize mismatch\n\nSituation 2: Image is corrupted\n  Image: [Blank/noise]\n  Text: \"A dog running\"\n\n  Should still align based on text\n\nSituation 3: Text is poorly written\n  Image: [Cat photo]\n  Text: \"teh kat iz vry smrt\"\n\n  Should understand despite bad spelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdea:\nProject both modalities to common space\nwhere similarity can be computed\n\nImage (2048D) --┐\n               ├─→ Shared Space (256D)\nText (768D) ───┘\n\nNow both in same space!\nCan compute cosine similarity directly\n\n\n\nStep 1: Learn projection matrices\nFor images:\n  W_img ∈ ℝ^(2048 × 256)\n  img_proj = W_img @ img_features\n\nFor text:\n  W_txt ∈ ℝ^(768 × 256)\n  txt_proj = W_txt @ txt_features\n\nBoth outputs: 256-dimensional vectors\nStep 2: Normalize in shared space\n# L2 normalize to unit length\nimg_proj = img_proj / ||img_proj||\ntxt_proj = txt_proj / ||txt_proj||\n\nResult:\n  Both vectors have magnitude 1\n  Can use cosine similarity = dot product\n  Similarity ∈ [-1, 1]\nStep 3: Compute similarity\nsimilarity = img_proj · txt_proj\n\n= Σ(img_proj_i × txt_proj_i)\n\nResult interpretation:\n  &gt; 0.8:   Very similar (matched pair)\n  0.5-0.8: Similar\n  0.3-0.5: Somewhat related\n  &lt; 0.3:   Different (unrelated pair)\n\n\n\nTraining objective:\nGoal: Maximize similarity of matched pairs\n      Minimize similarity of unmatched pairs\n\nDataset: Pairs (image_i, text_i) where i means matched\n\nLoss function (InfoNCE / Contrastive):\n\nL = -log[ exp(sim(img_i, txt_i) / τ) /\n          (exp(sim(img_i, txt_i) / τ) + Σ_j≠i exp(sim(img_i, txt_j) / τ)) ]\n\nIntuition:\n  Numerator: Similarity of correct pair (should be high)\n  Denominator: All pairs including incorrect ones\n  Loss: Make correct pair stand out from all others\nBatching strategy:\nBatch of 32 samples:\n\n[img_1] ────────┐\n[img_2] ────────┼─ All project to shared space\n[img_3] ────────┤\n...             │\n[img_32] ───────┘\n\n[txt_1] ────────┐\n[txt_2] ────────┼─ All project to shared space\n[txt_3] ────────┤\n...             │\n[txt_32] ───────┘\n\nSimilarity matrix (32×32):\n  sim(img_1, txt_1) = 0.95  ← Matched\n  sim(img_1, txt_2) = 0.2   ← Unmatched\n  sim(img_2, txt_2) = 0.94  ← Matched\n  ...\n\nLoss: Make diagonal elements high\n      Make off-diagonal elements low\nDimension selection:\nChoice of shared space dimension:\n\nSmall (64D):\n  ✓ Fast computation\n  ✓ Less memory\n  ✗ Information loss\n  ✗ Can't capture fine details\n\nMedium (256D):\n  ✓ Good balance\n  ✓ Standard choice\n  ✓ Preserves information\n\nLarge (1024D):\n  ✓ Maximum information\n  ✗ Slow computation\n  ✗ More memory\n  ✗ Risk of

global similarity\nBut doesn't tell us WHAT matched\n\nImage representation: Single 256D vector\n  Represents entire image\n  Loses spatial structure\n\nText representation: Single 256D vector\n  Represents entire sentence\n  Loses word-level information\n\nResult: Good for retrieval\n        Bad for understanding fine-grained relationships\n\nSolution: Cross-attention!\n\n\n\nCore idea:\nLet each part of one modality\n\"look at\" relevant parts of another modality\n\nText looks at image:\n  Word \"red\" ← attends to → Red pixels in image\n  Word \"cat\" ← attends to → Cat-shaped pixels in image\n\nImage looks at text:\n  Cat region ← attends to → \"cat\" and \"tabby\" words\n  Background ← attends to → \"room\" word\nMathematical formulation:\nCross-attention (Text queries, Image keys/values):\n\nQuery = Text embeddings (sequence length = # words)\nKey = Image patches from CNN (# patches = 196 for ViT)\nValue = Image patches\n\nAttention = softmax(Query @ Key^T / √d_k) @ Value\n\nResult:\n  Each word gets weighted combination of image patches\n  Weights reflect relevance (attention)\nConcrete example:\nText: \"The [red] cat [sits]\"\n       Word 1  Word 2  Word

Look around (attention mechanism)\n  2. Pay attention to Table 5 specifically\n  3. Focus 90% on Table 5\n  4. Glance at nearby tables (10% split)\n  5. Retrieve correct order from Table 5\n  6.

    "text": "Previous: Chapter 1: Introduction to Multimodal Learning | Next: Chapter 3: Feature Representation for Each Modality | Home: Table of Contents\n\n\n\nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to: - Understand the mathematical foundations of multimodal learning - Explain feature representation and embedding concepts - Describe similarity metrics used in multimodal systems - Understand modality normalization - Apply fundamental concepts to real problems\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: An embedding is a representation of data as a vector in a high-dimensional space.\nMathematical notation:\nFor data point x, its embedding e is:\ne ∈ ℝ^d\n\nwhere:\nd = dimensionality of embedding space\nℝ^d = d-dimensional real number space\n\nExample:\nImage of cat → e_image = [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ..., 0.1] ∈ ℝ^2048\nText \"cat\" → e_text = [0.1, 0.3, -0.2, ..., 0.5] ∈ ℝ^768\nWhy embeddings work:\nEmbeddings capture semantic meaning through: 1. Distance - Similar items have vectors close together 2. Direction - Related concepts align directionally 3. Magnitude - Can encode confidence or importance 4. Relationships - Vector arithmetic can represent semantic operations\nExample - Word2Vec:\nEmpirically discovered vector relationships:\n\nking - man + woman ≈ queen\n\nThis works because:\n- \"king\" and \"queen\" appear in similar contexts\n- \"man\" and \"woman\" capture gender transformation\n- Vector arithmetic preserves semantic relationships\n\n\n\nCore concept: We need ways to measure how similar two embeddings are.\n\n\nDefinition:\nsimilarity(u, v) = (u · v) / (||u|| × ||v||)\n\nwhere:\nu · v = dot product\n||u|| = L2 norm (magnitude)\n\nResult: Score in [-1, 1]\nGeometric intuition:\nangle between vectors = arc_cos(similarity)\n\nsimilarity = 1  → Same direction (identical)\nsimilarity = 0  → Perpendicular (unrelated)\nsimilarity = -1 → Opposite direction (contradictory)\nWhy preferred for embeddings: - Invariant to magnitude (direction matters, not size) - Computationally efficient - Interpretable as angle between vectors - Works well in high-dimensional spaces\nExample calculation:\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Vectors\nu = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0])\nv = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0])\n\n# Cosine similarity\ndot_product = np.dot(u, v)  # 1*1 + 0*0 + 1*1 + 0*0 = 2\nmagnitude_u = np.linalg.norm(u)  # sqrt(1+0+1+0) = 1.414\nmagnitude_v = np.linalg.norm(v)  # sqrt(1+0+1+0) = 1.414\n\nsimilarity = dot_product / (magnitude_u * magnitude_v)\n# = 2 / (1.414 * 1.414) = 1.0 (identical vectors)\n\n\n\nDefinition:\ndistance(u, v) = ||u - v|| = sqrt(Σ(u_i - v_i)^2)\n\nResult: Score in [0, ∞)\n- 0 means identical\n- Larger means more different\nWhen to use: - When absolute differences matter - In clustering algorithms - When coordinates have physical meaning\nDrawback for high dimensions: - “Curse of dimensionality” - distances become less meaningful - Cosine similarity preferred for embeddings\n\n\n\nDefinition:\ndistance(u, v) = Σ|u_i - v_i|\n\nResult: Sum of absolute differences\nAdvantages: - Computationally faster than Euclidean - Robust to outliers - Encourages sparsity\n\n\n\nDefinition:\nsimilarity(u, v) = u · v = Σ(u_i × v_i)\n\nResult: Score in (-∞, ∞)\n- Unbounded, depends on magnitude\nWhen to use: - In contrastive learning (with temperature scaling) - When magnitude carries meaning - With normalized vectors (then equivalent to cosine)\n\n\n\n\nWhy normalize?\nDifferent modalities have different value ranges:\nImage pixels: [0, 255] or [0, 1] after normalization\nText embeddings: [-1, 1] typically\nAudio: [-1, 1] normalized\n\nWithout normalization:\n- Similarity metrics behave unpredictably\n- Model training becomes unstable\n- Different modalities don't mix well\nCommon normalization techniques:\n1. Min-Max Normalization (Scaling)\nx_normalized = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))\n\nResult: All values in [0, 1]\nPreserves: Relationships and shape of distribution\n2. Z-Score Normalization (Standardization)\nx_normalized = (x - mean(x)) / std(x)\n\nResult: Mean = 0, Standard deviation = 1\nBenefit: Works well for values with Gaussian distribution\n3. L2 Normalization (Unit Vector)\nx_normalized = x / ||x||\n\nResult: Vector has magnitude 1\nProperty: Cosine similarity = dot product of L2-normalized vectors\n\nUsed in: CLIP, many embedding models\nExample - Normalizing image and text for comparison:\nRaw image features: [234, 1024, -500, ...]\nRaw text features: [0.023, -0.18, 0.51, ...]\n\nAfter L2 normalization:\nImage: [0.234, 0.298, -0.145, ...] (magnitude = 1)\nText: [0.0412, -0.321, 0.911, ...] (magnitude = 1)\n\nNow: Cosine similarity ≈ dot product\nBoth: Fair comparison despite different scales\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge: Convert diverse data types to vectors\nText: \"I love cats\"\n      ↓ (encoder)\n      [0.23, -0.51, 0.82, ..., 0.15] (768D)\n\nImage: [Cat photo]\n       ↓ (encoder)\n       [0.45, 0.12, -0.33, ..., 0.67] (2048D)\n\nAudio: [Cat meow sound]\n       ↓ (encoder)\n       [0.11, -0.09, 0.54, ..., -0.22] (768D)\n\n\n\nA good embedding should have:\n\nMeaningfulness\n\nSimilar inputs → similar vectors\nRelated concepts → nearby in space\n\nEfficiency\n\nReasonable dimensionality (not too large)\nFast to compute\nFast to compare\n\nStability\n\nSmall input changes → small embedding changes\nNoise in input shouldn’t drastically change embedding\n\nInterpretability (optional but helpful)\n\nCan understand what dimensions represent\nSome dimensions → face detection, others → color, etc.\n\nTransferability\n\nLearned embeddings work across tasks\nGeneralizes to new data\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon embedding dimensions:\nTask                          Typical Dimension\n────────────────────────────────────────────\nWord embeddings (Word2Vec)    300\nSentence embeddings (BERT)    768\nContextual text (GPT)         1536-2048\nImage (ResNet50)              2048\nImage (Vision Transformer)    768\nAudio (Wav2Vec2)              768\nMultimodal shared space       256-512\nDimensionality trade-off:\nToo small (e.g., 32D):\n  ✗ Information loss\n  ✗ Cannot capture complex relationships\n  ✓ Fast computation\n  ✓ Less memory\n  ✓ Less prone to overfitting\n\nToo large (e.g., 8192D):\n  ✓ Can capture fine details\n  ✓ Better expressiveness\n  ✗ Slow computation\n  ✗ High memory usage\n  ✗ Prone to overfitting\n  ✗ Curse of dimensionality (distances become uninformative)\n\nSweet spot: 256-2048D for most applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we can’t visualize high-dimensional spaces, we can use dimensionality reduction:\nt-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):\n2048D embedding space\n        ↓ (project to 2D while preserving relationships)\n2D visualization\n\nExample -

    "text": "Definition: An embedding is a representation of data as a vector in a high-dimensional space.\nMathematical notation:\nFor data point x, its embedding e is:\ne ∈ ℝ^d\n\nwhere:\nd = dimensionality of embedding space\nℝ^d = d-dimensional real number space\n\nExample:\nImage of cat → e_image = [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ..., 0.1] ∈ ℝ^2048\nText \"cat\" → e_text = [0.1, 0.3, -0.2, ..., 0.5] ∈ ℝ^768\nWhy embeddings work:\nEmbeddings capture semantic meaning through: 1. Distance - Similar items have vectors close together 2. Direction - Related concepts align directionally 3. Magnitude - Can encode confidence or importance 4. Relationships - Vector arithmetic can represent semantic operations\nExample - Word2Vec:\nEmpirically discovered vector relationships:\n\nking - man + woman ≈ queen\n\nThis works because:\n- \"king\" and \"queen\" appear in similar contexts\n- \"man\" and \"woman\" capture gender transformation\n- Vector arithmetic preserves semantic relationships\n\n\n\nCore concept: We need ways to measure how similar two embeddings are.\n\n\nDefinition:\nsimilarity(u, v) = (u · v) / (||u|| × ||v||)\n\nwhere:\nu · v = dot product\n||u|| = L2 norm (magnitude)\n\nResult: Score in [-1, 1]\nGeometric intuition:\nangle between vectors = arc_cos(similarity)\n\nsimilarity = 1  → Same direction (identical)\nsimilarity = 0  → Perpendicular (unrelated)\nsimilarity = -1 → Opposite direction (contradictory)\nWhy preferred for embeddings: - Invariant to magnitude (direction matters, not size) - Computationally efficient - Interpretable as angle between vectors - Works well in high-dimensional spaces\nExample calculation:\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Vectors\nu = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0])\nv = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0])\n\n# Cosine similarity\ndot_product = np.dot(u, v)  # 1*1 + 0*0 + 1*1 + 0*0 = 2\nmagnitude_u = np.linalg.norm(u)  # sqrt(1+0+1+0) = 1.414\nmagnitude_v = np.linalg.norm(v)  # sqrt(1+0+1+0) = 1.414\n\nsimilarity = dot_product / (magnitude_u * magnitude_v)\n# = 2 / (1.414 * 1.414) = 1.0 (identical vectors)\n\n\n\nDefinition:\ndistance(u, v) = ||u - v|| = sqrt(Σ(u_i - v_i)^2)\n\nResult: Score in [0, ∞)\n- 0 means identical\n- Larger means more different\nWhen to use: - When absolute differences matter - In clustering algorithms - When coordinates have physical meaning\nDrawback for high dimensions: - “Curse of dimensionality” - distances become less meaningful - Cosine similarity preferred for embeddings\n\n\n\nDefinition:\ndistance(u, v) = Σ|u_i - v_i|\n\nResult: Sum of absolute differences\nAdvantages: - Computationally faster than Euclidean - Robust to outliers - Encourages sparsity\n\n\n\nDefinition:\nsimilarity(u, v) = u · v = Σ(u_i × v_i)\n\nResult: Score in (-∞, ∞)\n- Unbounded, depends on magnitude\nWhen to use: - In contrastive learning (with temperature scaling) - When magnitude carries meaning - With normalized vectors (then equivalent to cosine)\n\n\n\n\nWhy normalize?\nDifferent modalities have different value ranges:\nImage pixels: [0, 255] or [0, 1] after normalization\nText embeddings: [-1, 1] typically\nAudio: [-1, 1] normalized\n\nWithout normalization:\n- Similarity metrics behave unpredictably\n- Model training becomes unstable\n- Different modalities don't mix well\nCommon normalization techniques:\n1. Min-Max Normalization (Scaling)\nx_normalized = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))\n\nResult: All values in [0, 1]\nPreserves: Relationships and shape of distribution\n2. Z-Score Normalization (Standardization)\nx_normalized = (x - mean(x)) / std(x)\n\nResult: Mean = 0, Standard deviation = 1\nBenefit: Works well for values with Gaussian distribution\n3. L2 Normalization (Unit Vector)\nx_normalized = x / ||x||\n\nResult: Vector has magnitude 1\nProperty: Cosine similarity = dot product of L2-normalized vectors\n\nUsed in: CLIP, many embedding models\nExample - Normalizing image and text for comparison:\nRaw image features: [234, 1024, -500, ...]\nRaw text features: [0.023, -0.18, 0.51, ...]\n\nAfter L2 normalization:\nImage: [0.234, 0.298, -0.145, ...] (magnitude = 1)\nText: [0.0412, -0.321, 0.911, ...] (magnitude = 1)\n\nNow: Cosine similarity ≈ dot product\nBoth: Fair comparison despite different scales",

Text generation:\nTask: Generate sentence about cats\n\nStep 0: Start with [START] token\n\nStep 1: Predict first word\n  Input: [START]\n  Model outputs: P(word | [START])\n  Distribution: {the: 0.3, a: 0.2, ..., cat: 0.05}\n  Sample: \"The\" (or use greedy: highest probability)\n\nStep 2: Predict second word\n  Input: [START] The\n  Model outputs: P(word | [START], The)\n  Distribution: {cat: 0.4, dog: 0.1, ...}\n  Sample: \"cat\"\n\nStep 3: Predict third word\n  Input: [START] The cat\n  Model outputs: P(word | [START], The, cat)\n  Distribution: {is: 0.5, sat: 0.2, ...}\n  Sample: \"is\"\n\nContinue until [END] token or maximum length\n\nResult: \"The cat is sleeping peacefully on the couch\"\n\n\n\nStrategy 1: Greedy Decoding\nAt each step, choose highest probability token\n\nAlgorithm:\n  for t in 1 to max_length:\n    logits = model(previous_tokens)\n    next_token = argmax(logits)\n    previous_tokens.append(next_token)\n\nAdvantages:\n  ✓ Fast (single forward pass per step)\n  ✓ Deterministic (same output every time)\n  ✓ Simple to implement\n\nDisadvantages:\n  ✗ Can get stuck in local optima\n  ✗ May produce suboptimal sequences\n  ✗ \"Does not\" → \"Does\" (highest prob) → \"not\" never chosen\n  ✗ No diversity (always same output)\n\nWhen to use:\n  - When consistency matters more than quality\n  - Real-time applications where speed critical\n  - Baseline comparisons\nStrategy 2: Beam Search\nKeep track of K best hypotheses\nExpand each by one token\nPrune to K best\n\nExample with K=3:\n\nStep 1:\n  Hypotheses: [\"The\", \"A\", \"One\"]\n  Scores: [0.3, 0.2, 0.15]\n\nStep 2 (expand each by one token):\n  From \"The\":\n    \"The cat\" (0.3 × 0.4 = 0.12)\n    \"The dog\" (0.3 × 0.1 = 0.03)\n    \"The bird\" (0.3 × 0.08 = 0.024)\n\n  From \"A\":\n    \"A cat\" (0.2 × 0.35 = 0.07)\n    \"A dog\" (0.2 × 0.15 = 0.03)\n    \"A bird\" (0.2 × 0.10 = 0.02)\n\n  From \"One\":\n    \"One cat\" (0.15 × 0.3 = 0.045)\n    ...\n\nStep 3 (keep top 3):\n  Best: \"The cat\" (0.12)\n  Second: \"The dog\" (0.03)\n  Third: \"A cat\" (0.07) or \"One cat\" (0.045)\n\nContinue...\n\nAlgorithm:\n  hypotheses = [[start_token]]\n  scores = [0]\n\n  for t in 1 to max_length:\n    candidates = []\n\n    for each hypothesis h in hypotheses:\n      logits = model(h)\n      for next_token in vocab:\n        score = scores[h] + log(logits[next_token])\n        candidates.append((h + [next_token], score))\n\n    # Keep best K\n    hypotheses, scores = topK(candidates, K)\n\n    # Stop if all ended\n    if all ended: break\n\n  return hypotheses[0]  # Best hypothesis\n\nAdvantages:\n  ✓ Better quality than greedy\n  ✓ Still relatively fast\n  ✓ Finds better global optimum\n\nDisadvantages:\n  ✗ Slower than greedy (K hypotheses tracked)\n  ✗ Still deterministic\n  ✗ No diversity\n\nWhen to use:\n  - Standard for machine translation\n  - When quality important but speed constrained\n  - Most common in practice\nStrategy 3: Sampling (Temperature-Based)\nInstead of greedy, sample from distribution\n\nAlgorithm:\n  for t in 1 to max_length:\n    logits = model(previous_tokens)\n    logits = logits / temperature\n    probabilities = softmax(logits)\n    next_token = sample(probabilities)\n    previous_tokens.append(next_token)\n\nTemperature effect:\n\ntemperature = 0.1 (cold - sharp):\n  Softmax becomes one-hot-like\n  Mostly sample highest probability\n  Like greedy but with small randomness\n  Output: Deterministic\n\ntemperature = 1.0 (normal):\n  Standard softmax\n  Sample according to distribution\n  Balanced randomness\n  Output: Somewhat random\n\ntemperature = 2.0 (hot - smooth):\n  Softmax becomes nearly uniform\n  All tokens equally likely\n  Very random generation\n  Output: Very random, often nonsensical\n\nExample:\n  Logits: [2.0, 1.0, 0.5]\n\n  Temperature 0.1:\n    After scaling: [20, 10, 5]\n    After softmax: [0.99, 0.01, 0.0]\n    Sample distribution: Mostly first token\n\n  Temperature 1.0:\n    After scaling: [2.0, 1.0, 0.5]\n    After softmax: [0.66, 0.24, 0.09]\n    Sample distribution: Balanced\n\n  Temperature 2.0:\n    After scaling: [1.0, 0.5, 0.25]\n    After softmax: [0.54, 0.30, 0.15]\n    Sample distribution: More uniform\n\nAdvantages:\n  ✓ Diverse outputs\n  ✓ Can be creative\n  ✓ Different each time\n\nDisadvantages:\n  ✗ Can produce nonsense\n  ✗ Quality depends on temperature tuning\n  ✗ Slower (need many samples to evaluate)\n\nWhen to use:\n  - Creative tasks (poetry, stories)\n  - When diversity valued\n  - User-facing applications (less repetitive)\nStrategy 4: Top-K Sampling\nOnly sample from K most probable tokens\n\nAlgorithm:\n  for t in 1 to max_length:\n    logits = model(previous_tokens)\n\n    # Get top K logits\n    topk_logits, topk_indices = topk(logits, K)\n\n    # Compute probabilities from only these K\n    probabilities = softmax(topk_logits)\n\n    # Sample from this restricted distribution\n    next_token_idx = sample(probabilities)\n    next_token = topk_indices[next_token_idx]\n\n    previous_tokens.append(next_token)\n\nExample with K=5:\n\nLogits: [5, 4, 3, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, ...]\nTop 5: [5, 4, 3, 1, 0.5]\nSoftmax of top 5: [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.08, 0.02]\n\nSample from these 5 tokens only\nNever sample from tail tokens\nStrategy 5: Top-P (Nucleus) Sampling\nSample from smallest set of tokens with cumulative probability &gt; p\n\nAlgorithm:\n  for t in 1 to max_length:\n    logits = model(previous_tokens)\n    probabilities = softmax(logits)\n\n    # Sort by probability descending\n    sorted_probs = sort(probabilities, descending=True)\n\n    # Find cutoff\n    cumsum = cumsum(sorted_probs)\n    cutoff_idx = first index where cumsum &gt; p\n\n    # Keep tokens up to cutoff\n    mask = cumsum &lt;= p\n\n    # Renormalize and sample\n    filtered_probs = probabilities * mask\n    filtered_probs = filtered_probs / sum(filtered_probs)\n\n    next_token = sample(filtered_probs)\n    previous_tokens.append(next_token)\n\nExample with p=0.9:\n\nProbabilities: [0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.05, 0.03, 0.02]\nCumsum: [0.5, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.98, 1.0]\n\nKeep tokens where cumsum &lt;= 0.9:\n  [0.5, 0.3, 0.1] with cumsum [0.5, 0.8, 0.9]\n\nSample from these three tokens\nNever sample from last three (low probability)\n\n\n\nTraining objective:\nGoal: Maximize probability of correct sequence\n\nFor sequence [w₁, w₂, w₃, w₄]:\n\nLoss = -log P(w₁, w₂, w₃, w₄)\n     = -log [P(w₁) × P(w₂|w₁) × P(w₃|w₁,w₂) × P(w₄|w₁,w₂,w₃)]\n     = -[log P(w₁) + log P(w₂|w₁) + log P(w₃|w₁,w₂) + log P(w₄|w₁,w₂,w₃)]\n\nEach term: Cross-entropy loss for predicting next token\n\nTotal loss = Sum of cross-entropy losses for each position\n\nGradient flows to each position\nAll trained simultaneously (efficient!)\nTeacher forcing:\nDuring training:\n  Use true tokens for context (not predicted tokens)\n\nWithout teacher forcing:\n  Step 1: Predict w₂ from w₁ (could be wrong)\n  Step 2: Predict w₃ from (w₁, [predicted w₂]) (error accumulates)\n  Step 3: Predict w₄ from (w₁, [predicted w₂], [predicted w₃]) (more errors)\n\nResult: Model learns on error distribution\n        Model overfits to teacher forcing\n        At test time, predicted tokens are different!\n\nWith teacher forcing:\n  Step 1: Predict w₂ from w₁ (true)\n  Step 2: Predict w₃ from (w₁, w₂) (true)\n  Step 3: Predict w₄ from (w₁, w₂, w₃) (true)\n\nResult: Clean training signal\n        But distribution mismatch at test time!\n\nSolution: Scheduled sampling\n  Start with teacher forcing\n  Gradually use predicted tokens during training\n  Mix of training and test distribution\nImplementation:\ndef train_autoregressive(model, sequences, optimizer, device):\n    \"\"\"Train autoregressive model with teacher forcing\"\"\"\n    model.train()\n    total_loss = 0\n\n    for sequence in sequences:\n        sequence = sequence.to(device)  # (seq_len,)\n\n        # Input: all but last token\n        input_ids = sequence[:-1]  # (seq_len-1,)\n\n        # Target: all but first token\n        target_ids = sequence[1:]  # (seq_len-1,)\n\n        # Forward pass\n        logits = model(input_ids)  # (seq_len-1, vocab_size)\n\n        # Compute loss\n        loss = F.cross_entropy(\n            logits.view(-1, vocab_size),\n            target_ids.view(-1)\n        )\n\n        # Backward pass\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n        loss.backward()\n        optimizer.step()\n\n        total_loss += loss.item()\n\n    return total_loss / len(sequences)",
