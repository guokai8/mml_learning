## How to Get Most from Examples

Each chapter includes code examples. To benefit maximally:

1. **Read the explanation first** - Understand the concept before seeing code
2. **Study the code** - Read through carefully, understand each line
3. **Run the code** - Execute in your environment, see it work
4. **Modify the code** - Change parameters, try variations, break it intentionally
5. **Implement from scratch** - After understanding, implement without looking at provided code

## Exercise Difficulty Levels

Exercises are marked with difficulty indicators:

- ⭐ **Beginner** - Tests understanding of basic concepts
- ⭐⭐ **Intermediate** - Requires combining multiple concepts
- ⭐⭐⭐ **Advanced** - Challenges you to think beyond the material
- 🏆 **Research** - Open-ended problems potentially suitable for research papers
